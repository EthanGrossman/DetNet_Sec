    <abstract>
      <t> A deterministic network is one that can carry data flows for real-time applications with
        extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency. Deterministic networks have been
        successfully deployed in real-time operational technology (OT) applications for some years
        (for example <xref target="ARINC664P7"/>). However, such networks are typically isolated
        from external access, and thus the security threat from external attackers is low. IETF
        Deterministic Networking (DetNet) specifies a set of technologies that enable creation of
        deterministic networks on IP-based networks of potentially wide area (on the scale of a
        corporate network) potentially bringing the OT network into contact with Information
        Technology (IT) traffic and security threats that lie outside of a tightly controlled and
        bounded area (such as the internals of an aircraft). These DetNet technologies have not
        previously been deployed together on a wide area IP-based network, and thus can present
        security considerations that may be new to IP-based wide area network designers. This draft,
        intended for use by DetNet network designers, provides insight into these security
        considerations. In addition, this draft collects all security-related statements from the
        various DetNet drafts (Architecture, Use Cases, etc) into a single location <xref
          target="appendix_a"/>. </t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t> Security is of particularly high importance in DetNet networks because many of the use
        cases which are enabled by DetNet <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-use-cases"/> include control
        of physical devices (power grid components, industrial controls, building controls) which
        can have high operational costs for failure, and present potentially attractive targets for
        cyber-attackers.</t>

      <t>This situation is even more acute given that one of the goals of DetNet is to provide a
        "converged network", i.e. one that includes both IT traffic and OT traffic, thus exposing
        potentially sensitive OT devices to attack in ways that were not previously common (usually
        because they were under a separate control system or otherwise isolated from the IT
        network). Security considerations for OT networks is not a new area, and there are many OT
        networks today that are connected to wide area networks or the Internet; this draft focuses
        on the issues that are specific to the DetNet technologies and use cases.</t>

      <t> The DetNet technologies include ways to: <list style="symbols">
          <t> Reserve data plane resources for DetNet flows in some or all of the intermediate nodes
            (e.g. bridges or routers) along the path of the flow</t>
          <t> Provide explicit routes for DetNet flows that do not rapidly change with the network
            topology</t>
          <t> Distribute data from DetNet flow packets over time and/or space to ensure delivery of
            each packet's data' in spite of the loss of a path</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t> This draft includes sections on threat modeling and analysis, threat impact and
        mitigation, and the association of attacks with use cases based on the Use Case Common
        Themes section of the DetNet Use Cases draft <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-use-cases"/>.</t>

      <t>This draft also provides context for the DetNet security considerations by collecting into
        one place <xref target="appendix_a"/> the various remarks about security from the various
        DetNet drafts (Use Cases, Architecture, etc). This text is duplicated here primarily because
        the DetNet working group has elected not to produce a Requirements draft and thus
        collectively these statements are as close as we have to "DetNet Security Requirements". </t>

    <section anchor="ThreatSection" title="Security Threats">
      <t>This section presents a threat model, and analyzes the possible threats in a DetNet-enabled
        network.</t>

      <t> We distinguish control plane threats from data plane threats. The attack surface may be
          the same, but the types of attacks as well as the motivation behind them, are different. For
          example, a delay attack is more relevant to data plane than to control plane. There is also
          a difference in terms of security solutions: the way you secure the data plane is often
          different than the way you secure the control plane. </t>

      <section title="Threat Model">
        <t>The threat model used in this memo is based on the threat model of Section 3.1 of <xref
            target="RFC7384"/>. This model classifies attackers based on two criteria:</t>

        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Internal vs. external: internal attackers either have access to a trusted segment of
              the network or possess the encryption or authentication keys. External attackers, on
              the other hand, do not have the keys and have access only to the encrypted or
              authenticated traffic.</t>
            <t>Man in the Middle (MITM) vs. packet injector: MITM attackers are located in a
              position that allows interception and modification of in-flight protocol packets,
              whereas a traffic injector can only attack by generating protocol packets.</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t> Care has also been taken to adhere to Section 5 of <xref target="RFC3552"/>, both with
          respect to what attacks are considered out-of-scope for this document, but also what is
          considered to be the most common threats (explored furhter in <xref
            target="ThreatAnalysis"/>. Most of the direct threats to DetNet are Active attacks, but
          it is highly suggested that DetNet application developers take appropriate measures to
          protect the content of the streams from passive attacks. </t>

        <t>DetNet-Service, one of the service scenarios described in <xref
            target="I-D.varga-detnet-service-model"/>, is the case where a service connects DetNet
          networking islands, i.e. two or more otherwise independent DetNet network domains are
          connected via a link that is not intrinsically part of either network. This implies that
          there could be DetNet traffic flowing over a non-DetNet link, which may provide an
          attacker with an advantageous opportunity to tamper with DetNet traffic. The security
          properties of non-DetNet links are outside of the scope of DetNet Security, but it should
          be noted that use of non-DetNet services to interconnect DetNet networks merits security
          analysis to ensure the integrity of the DetNet networks involved. </t>

      <section anchor="ThreatAnalysis" title="Threat Analysis">

        <section anchor="DelayThreat" title="Delay">
          <section title="Delay Attack">
            <t>An attacker can maliciously delay DetNet data flow traffic. By delaying the traffic,
              the attacker can compromise the service of applications that are sensitive to high
              delays or to high delay variation.</t>
          </section>

        </section>

        <section anchor="ModificationThreat" title="DetNet Flow Modification or Spoofing">
          <t>An attacker can modify some header fields of en route packets in a way that causes the
            DetNet flow identification mechanisms to misclassify the flow. Alternatively, the
            attacker can inject traffic that is tailored to appear as if it belongs to a legitimate
            DetNet flow. The potential consequence is that the DetNet flow resource allocation
            cannot guarantee the performance that is expected when the flow identification works
            correctly.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="SegmentThreat" title="Resource Segmentation or Slicing">
          <section title="Inter-segment Attack">
            <t>An attacker can inject traffic, consuming network device resources, thereby affecting
              DetNet flows. This can be performed using non-DetNet traffic that affects DetNet
              traffic, or by using DetNet traffic from one DetNet flow that affects traffic from
              different DetNet flows.</t>
          </section>

        </section>

        <section anchor="ReplicationThreat" title="Packet Replication and Elimination">
          <section title="Replication: Increased Attack Surface">
            <t>Redundancy is intended to increase the robustness and survivability of DetNet flows,
              and replication over multiple paths can potentially mitigate an attack that is limited
              to a single path. However, the fact that packets are replicated over multiple paths
              increases the attack surface of the network, i.e., there are more points in the
              network that may be subject to attacks.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Replication-related Header Manipulation">
            <t>An attacker can manipulate the replication-related header fields (R-TAG). This
              capability opens the door for various types of attacks. For example:</t>

            <t>
              <list style="symbols">
                <t>Forward both replicas - malicious change of a packet SN (Sequence Number) can
                  cause both replicas of the packet to be forwarded. Note that this attack has a
                  similar outcome to a replay attack.</t>

                <t>Eliminate both replicas - SN manipulation can be used to cause both replicas to
                  be eliminated. In this case an attacker that has access to a single path can cause
                  packets from other paths to be dropped, thus compromising some of the advantage of
                  path redundancy.</t>

                <t>Flow hijacking - an attacker can hijack a DetNet flow with access to a single
                  path by systematically replacing the SNs on the given path with higher SN values.
                  For example, an attacker can replace every SN value S with a higher value S+C,
                  where C is a constant integer. Thus, the attacker creates a false illusion that
                  the attacked path has the lowest delay, causing all packets from other paths to be
                  eliminated. Once the flow is hijacked the attacker can either replace en route
                  packets with malicious packets, or simply injecting errors, causing the packets to
                  be dropped at their destination.</t>
              </list>
            </t>

          </section>

        </section>

        <section anchor="PathThreat" title="Path Choice">
          <section title="Path Manipulation">
            <t>An attacker can maliciously change, add, or remove a path, thereby affecting the
              corresponding DetNet flows that use the path.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Path Choice: Increased Attack Surface">
            <t>One of the possible consequences of a path manipulation attack is an increased attack
              surface. Thus, when the attack described in the previous subsection is implemented, it
              may increase the potential of other attacks to be performed.</t>

          <section title="Control or Signaling Packet Injection">

            <t>A passive eavesdropper can identify DetNet flows and then gather information about en
              route DetNet flows, e.g., the number of DetNet flows, their bandwidths, and their
              schedules. The gathered information can later be used to invoke other attacks on some
              or all of the flows.</t>

            <t>Note that in some cases DetNet flows may be identified based on an explicit DetNet
              header, but in some cases the flow identification may be based on fields from the
              L3/L4 headers. If L3/L4 headers are involved, for purposes of this draft we assume
              they are encrypted and/or integrity-protected from external attackers. </t>

          internal and external attacks is under the assumption that a corresponding security
          mechanism is being used, and that the corresponding network equipment takes part in this
          mechanism.</t>

      <t> In computer security, the impact (or consequence) of an incident can be measured in loss
        of confidentiality, integrity or availability of information.</t>

      <t>DetNet raises these stakes significantly for OT applications, particularly those which may
        have been designed to run in an OT-only environment and thus may not have been designed for
        security in an IT environment with its associated devices, services and protocols. </t>

      <t>The severity of various components of the impact of a successful vulnerability exploit to
        use cases by industry is available in more detail in <xref
         target="I-D.ietf-detnet-use-cases"/>. Each of the use cases in the DetNet Use Cases draft
        is represented in the table below, including Pro Audio, Electrical Utilities, Industrial M2M
        (split into two areas, M2M Data Gathering and M2M Control Loop), and others.</t>

      <t>Components of Impact (left column) include Criticality of Failure, Effects of Failure,
        Recovery, and DetNet Functional Dependence. Criticality of failure summarizes the
        seriousness of the impact. The impact of a resulting failure can affect many different
        metrics that vary greatly in scope and severity. In order to reduce the number of variables,
        only the following were included: Financial, Health and Safety, People well being, Affect on
        a single organization, and affect on multiple organizations. Recovery outlines how long it
        would take for an affected use case to get back to its pre-failure state (Recovery time
        objective, RTO), and how much of the original service would be lost in between the time of
	service failure and recovery to original state (Recovery Point Objective, RPO). DetNet
        dependence maps how much the following DetNet service objectives contribute to impact of
        failure: Time dependency, data integrity, source node integrity, availability,
        latency/jitter.</t>

      <t>The scale of the Impact mappings is low, medium, and high. In some use cases there may be a
        multitude of specific applications in which DetNET is used. For simplicity this section
        attempts to average the varied impacts of different applications. This section does not
        address the overall risk of a certain impact which would require the likelihood of a failure
        happening. </t>

      <t>In practice any such ratings will vary from case to case; the ratings shown here are given
        as examples.</t>

          <t> Severely delayed messages in a DetNet link can result in the same behavior as dropped
            messages in ordinary networks as the services attached to the stream has strict
            deterministic requirements.</t>

          <t>For a single path scenario, disruption is a real possibility, whereas in a multipath
            scenario, large delays or instabilities in one stream can lead to increased buffer and
            CPU resources on the elimination bridge.</t>

              <t>Failure to deliver, or severely delaying, signalling messages adding an end-point
                to a multicast-group will prevent the new EP from receiving expected frames thus
                disrupting expected behavior.</t>

              <t>Delaying messages removing an EP from a group can lead to loss of privacy as the EP
                will continue to receive messages even after it is supposedly removed.</t>

              bridges throughout the network as it will increase buffer usage and CPU utilization.
              This can lead to resource exhaustion and/or increased delay.</t>
            <t>If the attacker manages to create valid headers, the false messages can be forwarded
              through the network, using part of the allocated bandwidth. This in turn can cause
              legitimate messages to be dropped when the budget has been exhausted.</t>

          <t>Injection of false messages in a DetNet stream could lead to exhaustion of the
            available bandwidth for a stream if the bridges accounts false messages to the stream's
            budget. </t>
          <t>In a multipath scenario, injected messages will cause increased CPU utilization in
            elimination bridges. If enough paths are subject to malicious injection, the legitimate
            messages can be dropped. Likewise it can cause an increase in buffer usage. In total, it

        <t> Of all the attacks, this is one of the most difficult to detect and counter. Often, an

          knowledge gathered in this phase to mount future attacks. </t>
        <t> The attacker can, at their leisure, observe over time all aspects of the messaging and
          signalling, learning the intent and purpose of all traffic flows. At some later date,
          possibly at an important time in an operational context, the attacker can launch a
          multi-faceted attack, possibly in conjunction with some demand for ransom. </t>
        <t> The flow-id in the header of the data plane-messages gives an attacker a very reliable

    <section title="Association of Attacks to Use Cases">

      <t>Different attacks can have different impact and/or mitigation depending on the use case, so
        we would like to make this association in our analysis. However since there is a potentially
        unbounded list of use cases, we categorize the attacks with respect to the common themes of
        the use cases as identified in the Use Case Common Themes section of the DetNet Use Cases
        draft <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-use-cases"/>. </t>

      <t>See also <xref target="ThreatIndustryMapping"/> for a mapping of the impact of attacks per
        use case by industry.</t>

      <section title="Use Cases by Common Themes">

        <t>In this section we review each theme and discuss the attacks that are applicable to that
          theme, as well as anything specific about the impact and mitigations for that attack with
          respect to that theme. The table <xref target="ThemeAttackMapping"/> then provides a
          summary of the attacks that are applicable to each theme. </t>

        <section title="Network Layer - AVB/TSN Ethernet">
          <t>DetNet is expected to run over various transmission mediums, with Ethernet being
            explicitly supported. Attacks such as Delay or Reconnaissance might be implemented
            differently on a different transmission medium, however the impact on the DetNet as a
            whole would be essentially the same. We thus conclude that all attacks and impacts that
            would be applicable to DetNet over Ethernet (i.e. all those named in this draft) would
            also be applicable to DetNet over other transmission mediums. </t>

          <t>With respect to mitigations, some methods are specific to the Ethernet medium, for
            example time-aware scheduling using 802.1Qbv can protect against excessive use of
            bandwidth at the ingress - for other mediums, other mitigations would have to be
            implemented to provide analogous protection. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Central Administration">
          <t>A DetNet network is expected to be controlled by a centralized network configuration
            and control system (CNC). Such a system may be in a single central location, or it may
            be distributed across multiple control entities that function together as a unified
            control system for the network. </t>

          <t>In this draft we distinguish between attacks on the DetNet Control plane vs. Data
            plane. But is an attack affecting control plane packets synonymous with an attack on the
            CNC itself? For purposes of this draft let us consider an attack on the CNC itself to be
            out of scope, and consider all attacks named in this draft which are relevant to control
            plane packets to be relevant to this theme, including Path Manipulation, Path Choice,
            Control Packet Modification or Injection, Reconaissance and Attacks on Time Sync
            Mechanisms. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Hot Swap">
          <t>A DetNet network is not expected to be "plug and play" - it is expected that there is
            some centralized network configuration and control system. However, the ability to "hot
            swap" components (e.g. due to malfunction) is similar enough to "plug and play" that
            this kind of behavior may be expected in DetNet networks, depending on the
            implementation. </t>
          <t>An attack surface related to Hot Swap is that the DetNet network must at least consider
            input at runtime from devices that were not part of the initial configuration of the
            network. Even a "perfect" (or "hitless") replacement of a device at runtime would not
            necessarily be ideal, since presumably one would want to distinguish it from the
            original for OAM purposes (e.g. to report hot swap of a failed device). </t>
          <t>This implies that an attack such as Flow Modification, Spoofing or Inter-segment (which
            could introduce packets from a "new" device (i.e. one heretofore unknown on the network)
            could be used to exploit the need to consider such packets (as opposed to rejecting them
            out of hand as one would do if one did not have to consider introduction of a new
            device).</t>
          <t>Similarly if the network was designed to support runtime replacement of a clock device,
            then presence (or apparent presence) and thus consideration of packets from a new such
            device could affect the network, or the time sync of the network, for example by
            initiating a new Best Master Clock selection process. Thus attacks on time sync should
            be considered when designing hot swap type functionality. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Data Flow Information Models">
          <t> Data Flow Information Models specific to DetNet networks are to be specified by
            DetNet. Thus they are "new" and thus potentially present a new attack surface. Does the
            threat take advantage of any aspect of our new Data Flow Info Models? </t>
          <t>This is TBD, thus there are no specific entries in our table, however that does not
            imply that there could be no relevant attacks.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="L2 and L3 Integration">
          <t>A DetNet network integrates Layer 2 (bridged) networks (e.g. AVB/TSN LAN) and Layer 3
            (routed) networks via the use of well-known protocols such as IPv6, MPLS-PW, and
            Ethernet. Presumably security considerations applicable directly to those individual
            protocols is not specific to DetNet, and thus out of scope for this draft. However
            enabling DetNet to coordinate Layer 2 and Layer 3 behavior will require some additions
            to existing protocols (see draft-dt-detnet-dp-alt) and any such new work can introduce
            new attack surfaces. </t>
          <t>This is TBD, thus there are no specific entries in our table, however that does not
            imply that there could be no relevant attacks.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="End-to-End Delivery">
          <t>Packets sent over DetNet are guaranteed not to be dropped by the network due to
            congestion. (Packets may however be dropped for intended reasons, e.g. per security
            measures). </t>
          <t>A Data plane attack may force packets to be dropped, for example a "long" Delay or
            Replication/Elimination or Flow Modification attack. </t>
          <t>The same result might be obtained by a Control plane attack, e.g. Path Manipulation or
            Signaling Packet Modification.</t>
          <t>It may be that such attacks are limited to Internal MITM attackers, but other
            possibilities should be considered.</t>
          <t>An attack may also cause packets that should not be delivered to be delivered, such as
            by forcing packets from one (e.g. replicated) path to be preferred over another path
            when they should not be (Replication attack), or by Flow Modification, or by Path Choice
            or Packet Injection. A Time Sync attack could cause a system that was expecting certain
            packets at certain times to accept unintended packets based on compromised system time
            or time windowing in the scheduler. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Proprietary Deterministic Ethernet Networks">
          <t>There are many proprietary non-interoperable deterministic Ethernet-based networks
            currently available; DetNet is intended to provide an open-standards-based alternative
            to such networks. In cases where a DetNet intersects with remnants of such networks or
            their protocols, such as by protocol emulation or access to such a network via a
            gateway, new attack surfaces can be opened. </t>
          <t>For example an Inter-Segment or Control plane attack such as Path Manipulation, Path
            Choice or Control Packet Modification/Injection could be used to exploit commands
            specific to such a protocol, or that are interpreted differently by the different
            protocols or gateway. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Replacement for Proprietary Fieldbuses">
          <t>There are many proprietary "field buses" used in today's industrial and other
            industries; DetNet is intended to provide an open-standards-based alternative to such
            buses. In cases where a DetNet intersects with such fieldbuses or their protocols, such
            as by protocol emulation or access via a gateway, new attack surfaces can be opened.</t>
          <t>For example an Inter-Segment or Control plane attack such as Path Manipulation, Path
            Choice or Control Packet Modification/Injection could be used to exploit commands
            specific to such a protocol, or that are interpreted differently by the different
            protocols or gateway. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Deterministic vs Best-Effort Traffic">
          <t>DetNet is intended to support coexistence of time-sensitive operational (OT,
            deterministic) traffic and information (IT, "best effort") traffic on the same
            ("unified") network. </t>
          <t>The presence of IT traffic on a network carrying OT traffic has long been considered
            insecure design [reference needed here]. With DetNet, this coexistance will become more
            common, and mitigations will need to be established. The fact that the IT traffic on a
            DetNet is limited to a corporate controlled network makes this a less difficult problem
            compared to being exposed to the open Internet, however this aspect of DetNet security
            should not be underestimated. </t>
          <t>Most of the themes described in this draft address OT (reserved) streams - this item is
            intended to address issues related to IT traffic on a DetNet.</t>
          <t>An Inter-segment attack can flood the network with IT-type traffic with the intent of
            disrupting handling of IT traffic, and/or the goal of interfering with OT traffic.
            Presumably if the stream reservation and isolation of the DetNet is well-designed
            (better-designed than the attack) then interference with OT traffic should not result
            from an attack that floods the network with IT traffic. </t>
          <t>However the DetNet's handling of IT traffic may not (by design) be as resilient to DOS
            attack, and thus designers must be otherwise prepared to mitigate DOS attacks on IT
            traffic in a DetNet.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Deterministic Flows">
          <t>Reserved bandwidth data flows (deterministic flows) must provide the allocated
            bandwidth, and must be isolated from each other. </t>
          <t>A Spoofing or Inter-segment attack which adds packet traffic to a bandwidth-reserved
            stream could cause that stream to occupy more bandwidth than it is allocated, resulting
            in interference with other deterministic flows.</t>
          <t>A Flow Modification or Spoofing or Header Manipulation or Control Packet Modification
            attack could cause packets from one flow to be directed to another flow, thus breaching
            isolation between the flows.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Unused Reserved Bandwidth">
          <t>If bandwidth reservations are made for a stream but the associated bandwidth is not
            used at any point in time, that bandwidth is made available on the network for
            best-effort traffic. If the owner of the reserved stream then starts transmitting again,
            the bandwidth is no longer available for best-effort traffic, on a moment-to-moment
            basis. (Such "temporarily available" bandwidth is not available for time-sensitive
            traffic, which must have its own reservation). </t>
          <t>An Inter-segment attack could flood the network with IT traffic, interfering with the
            intended IT traffic.</t>
          <t>A Flow Modification or Spoofing or Control Packet Modification or Injection attack
            could cause extra bandwidth to be reserved by a new or existing stream, thus making it
            unavailable for use by best-effort traffic. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Interoperability">
          <t>The DetNet network specifications are intended to enable an ecosystem in which multiple
            vendors can create interoperable products, thus promoting device diversity and
            potentially higher numbers of each device manufactured. Does the threat take advantage
            of differences in implementation of "interoperable" products made by different
            vendors?</t>
          <t>This is TBD, thus there are no specific entries in our table, however that does not
            imply that there could be no relevant attacks.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Cost Reductions">
          <t>The DetNet network specifications are intended to enable an ecosystem in which multiple
            vendors can create interoperable products, thus promoting higher numbers of each device
            manufactured, promoting cost reduction and cost competition among vendors. Does the
            threat take advantage of "low cost" HW or SW components or other "cost-related
            shortcuts" that might be present in devices? </t>
          <t>This is TBD, thus there are no specific entries in our table, however that does not
            imply that there could be no relevant attacks.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Insufficiently Secure Devices">
          <t>The DetNet network specifications are intended to enable an ecosystem in which multiple
            vendors can create interoperable products, thus promoting device diversity and
            potentially higher numbers of each device manufactured. Does the threat attack "naivete"
            of SW, for example SW that was not designed to be sufficiently secure (or secure at all)
            but is deployed on a DetNet network that is intended to be highly secure? (For example
            IoT exploits like the Mirai video-camera botnet (<xref target="MIRAI"/>). </t>
          <t>This is TBD, thus there are no specific entries in our table, however that does not
            imply that there could be no relevant attacks.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="DetNet Network Size">
          <t>DetNet networks range in size from very small, e.g. inside a single industrial machine,
            to very large, for example a Utility Grid network spanning a whole country. </t>
          <t>The size of the network might be related to how the attack is introduced into the
            network, for example if the entire network is local, there is a threat that power can be
            cut to the entire network. If the network is large, perhaps only a part of the network
            is attacked. </t>
          <t>A Delay attack might be as relevant to a small network as to a large network, although
            the amount of delay might be different. </t>
          <t>Attacks sourced from IT traffic might be more likely in large networks, since more
            people might have access to the network. Similarly Path Manipulation, Path Choice and
            Time Sync attacks seem more likely relevant to large networks.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Multiple Hops">
          <t>Large DetNet networks (e.g. a Utility Grid network) may involve many "hops" over
            various kinds of links for example radio repeaters, microwave links, fiber optic links,
            etc.. </t>
          <t>An attack that takes advantage of flaws (or even normal operation) in the device
            drivers for the various links (through internal knowledge of how the individual driver
            or firmware operates, perhaps like the Stuxnet attack) could take proportionately
            greater advantage of this topology. We don't currently have an attack like this defined;
            we have only "protocol" (time or packet) based attacks. Perhaps we need to define an
            attack like this? Or is that out of scope for DetNet?</t>
          <t>It is also possible that this DetNet topology will not be in as common use as other
            more homogeneous topologies so there may be more opportunity for attackers to exploit
            software and/or protocol flaws in the implementations which have not been wrung out by
            extensive use, particularly in the case of early adopters.</t>
          <t>Of the attacks we have defined, the ones identified above as relevant to "large"
            networks seem to be most relevant.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Level of Service">
          <t>A DetNet is expected to provide means to configure the network that include querying
            network path latency, requesting bounded latency for a given stream, requesting worst
            case maximum and/or minimum latency for a given path or stream, and so on. It is an
            expected case that the network cannot provide a given requested service level. In such
            cases the network control system should reply that the requested service level is not
            available (as opposed to accepting the parameter but then not delivering the desired
            behavior). </t>
          <t>Control plane attacks such as Signaling Packet Modification and Injection could be used
            to modify or create control traffic that could interfere with the process of a user
            requesting a level of service and/or the network's reply.</t>
          <t>Reconnaissance could be used to characterize flows and perhaps target specific flows
            for attack via the Control plane as noted above.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Bounded Latency">
          <t>DetNet provides the expectation of guaranteed bounded latency. </t>
          <t>Delay attacks can cause packets to miss their agreed-upon latency boundaries.</t>
          <t>Time Sync attacks can corrupt the system's time reference, resulting in missed latency
            deadlines (with respect to the "correct" time reference).</t>

        </section>

        <section title="Low Latency">
          <t>Applications may require "extremely low latency" however depending on the application
            these may mean very different latency values; for example "low latency" across a Utility
            grid network is on a different time scale than "low latency" in a motor control loop in
            a small machine. The intent is that the mechanisms for specifying desired latency
            include wide ranges, and that architecturally there is nothing to prevent arbitrarily
            low latencies from being implemented in a given network. </t>
          <t>Attacks on the Control plane (as described in the Level of Service theme) and Delay and
            Time attacks (as described in the Bounded Latency theme) both apply here. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Symmetrical Path Delays">
          <t>Some applications would like to specify that the transit delay time values be equal for
            both the transmit and return paths. </t>
          <t>Delay attacks can cause path delays to differ.</t>
          <t>Time Sync attacks can corrupt the system's time reference, resulting in differing path
            delays (with respect to the "correct" time reference).</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Reliability and Availability">
          <t>DetNet based systems are expected to be implemented with essentially arbitrarily high
            availability (for example 99.9999% up time, or even 12 nines). The intent is that the
            DetNet designs should not make any assumptions about the level of reliability and
            availability that may be required of a given system, and should define parameters for
            communicating these kinds of metrics within the network. </t>

          <t>Any attack on the system, of any type, can affect its overall reliability and
            availability, thus in our table we have marked every attack. Since every DetNet depends
            to a greater or lesser degree on reliability and availability, this essentially means
            that all networks have to mitigate all attacks, which to a greater or lesser degree
            defeats the purpose of associating attacks with use cases. It also underscores the
            difficulty of designing "extremely high reliability" networks. I hope that in future
            drafts we can say something more useful here.</t>

        <section title="Redundant Paths">
          <t>DetNet based systems are expected to be implemented with essentially arbitrarily high
            reliability/availability. A strategy used by DetNet for providing such extraordinarily
            high levels of reliability is to provide redundant paths that can be seamlessly switched
            between, all the while maintaining the required performance of that system. </t>
          <t>Replication-related attacks are by definition applicable here. Control plane attacks
            can also interfere with the configuration of redundant paths.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Security Measures">
          <t>A DetNet network must be made secure against devices failures, attackers, misbehaving
            devices, and so on. Does the threat affect such security measures themselves, e.g. by
            attacking SW designed to protect against device failure? </t>
          <t>This is TBD, thus there are no specific entries in our table, however that does not
            imply that there could be no relevant attacks.</t>

    <section title="Appendix A: DetNet Draft Security-Related Statements" anchor="appendix_a">
      <t>This section collects the various statements in the currently existing DetNet Working Group
        drafts. For each draft, the section name and number of the quoted section is shown. The text
        shown here is the work of the original draft authors, quoted verbatim from the drafts. The
        intention is to explicitly quote all relevant text, not to summarize it.</t>

      <section title="Architecture (draft 8)">
        <section title="Fault Mitigation (sec 4.5)">
          <t>One key to building robust real-time systems is to reduce the infinite variety of
            possible failures to a number that can be analyzed with reasonable confidence. DetNet
            aids in the process by providing filters and policers to detect DetNet packets received
            on the wrong interface, or at the wrong time, or in too great a volume, and to then take
            actions such as discarding the offending packet, shutting down the offending DetNet
            flow, or shutting down the offending interface. </t>
          <t>It is also essential that filters and service remarking be employed at the network edge
            to prevent non-DetNet packets from being mistaken for DetNet packets, and thus impinging
            on the resources allocated to DetNet packets. </t>
          <t>There exist techniques, at present and/or in various stages of standardization, that
            can perform these fault mitigation tasks that deliver a high probability that
            misbehaving systems will have zero impact on well-behaved DetNet flows, except of
            course, for the receiving interface(s) immediately downstream of the misbehaving device.
            Examples of such techniques include traffic policing functions (e.g. [RFC2475]) and
            separating flows into per-flow rate- limited queues. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Security Considerations (sec 7)">
          <t>Security in the context of Deterministic Networking has an added dimension; the time of
            delivery of a packet can be just as important as the contents of the packet, itself. A
            man-in-the-middle attack, for example, can impose, and then systematically adjust,
            additional delays into a link, and thus disrupt or subvert a real-time application
            without having to crack any encryption methods employed. See <xref target="RFC7384"/>
            for an exploration of this issue in a related context. </t>
          <t>Furthermore, in a control system where millions of dollars of equipment, or even human
            lives, can be lost if the DetNet QoS is not delivered, one must consider not only simple
            equipment failures, where the box or wire instantly becomes perfectly silent, but
            bizarre errors such as can be caused by software failures. Because there is essential no
            limit to the kinds of failures that can occur, protecting against realistic equipment
            failures is indistinguishable, in most cases, from protecting against malicious
            behavior, whether accidental or intentional. </t>

      <section title="Problem Statement (draft 5)">
        <section title="Security Considerations (sec 5)">
          <t>Security in the context of Deterministic Networking has an added dimension; the time of
            delivery of a packet can be just as important as the contents of the packet, itself. A
            man-in-the-middle attack, for example, can impose, and then systematically adjust,

            exploration of this issue in a related context.</t>

          <t>Typical control networks today rely on complete physical isolation to prevent rogue
            access to network resources. DetNet enables the virtualization of those networks over a
            converged IT/OT infrastructure. Doing so, DetNet introduces an additional risk that
            flows interact and interfere with one another as they share physical resources such as
            Ethernet trunks and radio spectrum. The requirement is that there is no possible data
            leak from and into a deterministic flow, and in a more general fashion there is no
            possible influence whatsoever from the outside on a deterministic flow. The expectation
            is that physical resources are effectively associated with a given flow at a given point
            of time. In that model, Time Sharing of physical resources becomes transparent to the
            individual flows which have no clue whether the resources are used by other flows at
            other times. </t>

      <section title="Use Cases (draft 11)" anchor="use_cases">
        <section title="(Utility Networks) Security Current Practices and Limitations (sec 3.2.1)">
          <t>Grid monitoring and control devices are already targets for cyber attacks, and legacy
            telecommunications protocols have many intrinsic network-related vulnerabilities. For
            example, DNP3, Modbus, PROFIBUS/PROFINET, and other protocols are designed around a
            common paradigm of request and respond. Each protocol is designed for a master device
            such as an HMI (Human Machine Interface) system to send commands to subordinate slave
            devices to retrieve data (reading inputs) or control (writing to outputs). Because many
            of these protocols lack authentication, encryption, or other basic security measures,
            they are prone to network-based attacks, allowing a malicious actor or attacker to
            utilize the request-and-respond system as a mechanism for command-and-control like
            functionality. Specific security concerns common to most industrial control, including
            utility telecommunication protocols include the following: </t>
          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>Network or transport errors (e.g. malformed packets or excessive latency) can cause
                protocol failure. </t>
              <t>Protocol commands may be available that are capable of forcing slave devices into
                inoperable states, including powering-off devices, forcing them into a listen-only
                state, disabling alarming. </t>
              <t>Protocol commands may be available that are capable of restarting communications
                and otherwise interrupting processes. </t>
              <t>Protocol commands may be available that are capable of clearing, erasing, or
                resetting diagnostic information such as counters and diagnostic registers. </t>
              <t>Protocol commands may be available that are capable of requesting sensitive
                information about the controllers, their configurations, or other need-to-know
                information. </t>
              <t>Most protocols are application layer protocols transported over TCP; therefore it
                is easy to transport commands over non-standard ports or inject commands into
                authorized traffic flows. </t>
              <t>Protocol commands may be available that are capable of broadcasting messages to
                many devices at once (i.e. a potential DoS). </t>
              <t>Protocol commands may be available to query the device network to obtain defined
                points and their values (i.e. a configuration scan). </t>
              <t>Protocol commands may be available that will list all available function codes
                (i.e. a function scan). </t>
              <t> These inherent vulnerabilities, along with increasing connectivity between IT an
                OT networks, make network-based attacks very feasible. </t>
              <t>Simple injection of malicious protocol commands provides control over the target
                process. Altering legitimate protocol traffic can also alter information about a
                process and disrupt the legitimate controls that are in place over that process. A
                man-in-the-middle attack could provide both control over a process and
                misrepresentation of data back to operator consoles. </t>

        <section title="(Utility Networks) Security Trends in Utility Networks (sec 3.3.3)">
          <t>Although advanced telecommunications networks can assist in transforming the energy
            industry by playing a critical role in maintaining high levels of reliability,
            performance, and manageability, they also introduce the need for an integrated security
            infrastructure. Many of the technologies being deployed to support smart grid projects
            such as smart meters and sensors can increase the vulnerability of the grid to attack.
            Top security concerns for utilities migrating to an intelligent smart grid
            telecommunications platform center on the following trends: </t>
          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>Integration of distributed energy resources </t>
              <t>Proliferation of digital devices to enable management, automation, protection, and
                control </t>
              <t>Regulatory mandates to comply with standards for critical infrastructure protection </t>
              <t>Migration to new systems for outage management, distribution automation,
                condition-based maintenance, load forecasting, and smart metering </t>
              <t>Demand for new levels of customer service and energy management </t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>This development of a diverse set of networks to support the integration of microgrids,
            open-access energy competition, and the use of network-controlled devices is driving the
            need for a converged security infrastructure for all participants in the smart grid,
            including utilities, energy service providers, large commercial and industrial, as well
            as residential customers. Securing the assets of electric power delivery systems (from
            the control center to the substation, to the feeders and down to customer meters)
            requires an end-to-end security infrastructure that protects the myriad of
            telecommunications assets used to operate, monitor, and control power flow and
            measurement. </t>
          <t>"Cyber security" refers to all the security issues in automation and telecommunications
            that affect any functions related to the operation of the electric power systems.
            Specifically, it involves the concepts of: </t>
          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>Integrity : data cannot be altered undetectably </t>
              <t>Authenticity : the telecommunications parties involved must be validated as genuine </t>
              <t>Authorization : only requests and commands from the authorized users can be
                accepted by the system </t>
              <t>Confidentiality : data must not be accessible to any unauthenticated users </t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>When designing and deploying new smart grid devices and telecommunications systems, it
            is imperative to understand the various impacts of these new components under a variety
            of attack situations on the power grid. Consequences of a cyber attack on the grid
            telecommunications network can be catastrophic. This is why security for smart grid is
            not just an ad hoc feature or product, it's a complete framework integrating both
            physical and Cyber security requirements and covering the entire smart grid networks
            from generation to distribution. Security has therefore become one of the main
            foundations of the utility telecom network architecture and must be considered at every
            layer with a defense-in-depth approach. Migrating to IP based protocols is key to
            address these challenges for two reasons: </t>
          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>IP enables a rich set of features and capabilities to enhance the security posture </t>
              <t>IP is based on open standards, which allows interoperability between different
                vendors and products, driving down the costs associated with implementing security
                solutions in OT networks. </t>

            i.e., consideration must be given to enforcing electronic access control for both
            person-to-machine and machine-to-machine communications, and providing the appropriate
            levels of data privacy, device and platform integrity, and threat detection and
            mitigation. </t>

        <section title="(BAS) Security Considerations (sec 4.2.4)">
          <t>When BAS field networks were developed it was assumed that the field networks would
            always be physically isolated from external networks and therefore security was not a
            concern. In today's world many BASs are managed remotely and are thus connected to
            shared IP networks and so security is definitely a concern, yet security features are
            not available in the majority of BAS field network deployments . </t>
          <t>The management network, being an IP-based network, has the protocols available to
            enable network security, but in practice many BAS systems do not implement even the
            available security features such as device authentication or encryption for data in
            transit. </t>

        <section title="(6TiSCH) Security Considerations (sec 5.3.3)">
          <t>On top of the classical requirements for protection of control signaling, it must be
            noted that 6TiSCH networks operate on limited resources that can be depleted rapidly in
            a DoS attack on the system, for instance by placing a rogue device in the network, or by
            obtaining management control and setting up unexpected additional paths. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="(Cellular radio) Security Considerations (sec 6.1.5)">
          <t>Establishing time-sensitive streams in the network entails reserving networking
            resources for long periods of time. It is important that these reservation requests be
            authenticated to prevent malicious reservation attempts from hostile nodes (or
            accidental misconfiguration). This is particularly important in the case where the
            reservation requests span administrative domains. Furthermore, the reservation
            information itself should be digitally signed to reduce the risk of a legitimate node
            pushing a stale or hostile configuration into another networking node. </t>
          <t>Note: This is considered important for the security policy of the network, but does not
            affect the core DetNet architecture and design.</t>

        <section title="(Industrial M2M) Communication Today (sec 7.2)">
          <t>Industrial network scenarios require advanced security solutions. Many of the current
            industrial production networks are physically separated. Preventing critical flows from
            be leaked outside a domain is handled today by filtering policies that are typically
            enforced in firewalls. </t>
