    <abstract>
      <t> A deterministic network is one that can carry data flows for real-time applications with
        extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency. Deterministic networks have been
        successfully deployed in real-time operational technology (OT) applications for some years
        (for example <xref target="ARINC664P7"/>). However, such networks are typically isolated
        from external access, and thus the security threat from external attackers is low. IETF
        Deterministic Networking (DetNet) specifies a set of technologies that enable creation of
        deterministic networks on IP-based networks of potentially wide area (on the scale of a
        corporate network) potentially bringing the OT network into contact with Information
        Technology (IT) traffic and security threats that lie outside of a tightly controlled and
        bounded area (such as the internals of an aircraft). These DetNet technologies have not
        previously been deployed together on a wide area IP-based network, and thus can present
        security considerations that may be new to IP-based wide area network designers. This draft,
        intended for use by DetNet network designers, provides insight into these security
        considerations. In addition, this draft collects all security-related statements from the
        various DetNet drafts (Architecture, Use Cases, etc) into a single location <xref
          target="appendix_a"/>. </t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t> Security is of particularly high importance in DetNet networks because many of the use
        cases which are enabled by DetNet <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-use-cases"/> include control
        of physical devices (power grid components, industrial controls, building controls) which
        can have high operational costs for failure, and present potentially attractive targets for
        cyber-attackers.</t>

      <t>This situation is even more acute given that one of the goals of DetNet is to provide a
        "converged network", i.e. one that includes both IT traffic and OT traffic, thus exposing
        potentially sensitive OT devices to attack in ways that were not previously common (usually
        because they were under a separate control system or otherwise isolated from the IT
        network). Security considerations for OT networks is not a new area, and there are many OT
        networks today that are connected to wide area networks or the Internet; this draft focuses
        on the issues that are specific to the DetNet technologies and use cases.</t>

      <t> The DetNet technologies include ways to: <list style="symbols">
          <t> Reserve data plane resources for DetNet flows in some or all of the intermediate nodes
            (e.g. bridges or routers) along the path of the flow</t>
          <t> Provide explicit routes for DetNet flows that do not rapidly change with the network
            topology</t>
          <t> Distribute data from DetNet flow packets over time and/or space to ensure delivery of
            each packet's data' in spite of the loss of a path</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t> This draft includes sections on threat modeling and analysis, threat impact and
        mitigation, and the association of various attacks with various use cases both by industry
        and based on the Use Case Common Themes section of the DetNet Use Cases draft <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-detnet-use-cases"/>.</t>

      <t>This draft also provides context for the DetNet security considerations by collecting into
        one place <xref target="appendix_a"/> the various remarks about security from the various
        DetNet drafts (Use Cases, Architecture, etc). This text is duplicated here primarily because
        the DetNet working group has elected not to produce a Requirements draft and thus
        collectively these statements are as close as we have to "DetNet Security Requirements". </t>

    <section anchor="ThreatSection" title="Security Threats">
      <t>This section presents a threat model, and analyzes the possible threats in a DetNet-enabled
        network.</t>

      <t> We distinguish control plane threats from data plane threats. The attack surface may be
        the same, but the types of attacks are different. For example, a delay attack is more
        relevant to data plane than to control plane. There is also a difference in terms of
        security solutions: the way you secure the data plane is often different than the way you
        secure the control plane. </t>

      <section title="Threat Model">
        <t>The threat model used in this memo is based on the threat model of Section 3.1 of <xref
            target="RFC7384"/>. This model classifies attackers based on two criteria:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Internal vs. external: internal attackers either have access to a trusted segment of
              the network or possess the encryption or authentication keys. External attackers, on
              the other hand, do not have the keys and have access only to the encrypted or
              authenticated traffic.</t>
            <t>Man in the Middle (MITM) vs. packet injector: MITM attackers are located in a
              position that allows interception and modification of in-flight protocol packets,
              whereas a traffic injector can only attack by generating protocol packets.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>DetNet-Service, one of the service scenarios described in <xref
            target="I-D.varga-detnet-service-model"/>, is the case where a service connects DetNet
          networking islands, i.e. two or more otherwise independent DetNet network domains are
          connected via a link that is not intrinsically part of either network. This implies that
          there could be DetNet traffic flowing over a non-DetNet link, which may provide an
          attacker with an advantageous opportunity to tamper with DetNet traffic. The security
          properties of non-DetNet links are outside of the scope of DetNet Security, but it should
          be noted that use of non-DetNet services to interconnect DetNet networks merits security
          analysis to ensure the integrity of the DetNet networks involved. </t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="ThreatAnalysis" title="Threat Analysis">

        <section anchor="DelayThreat" title="Delay">
          <section title="Delay Attack">
            <t>An attacker can maliciously delay DetNet data flow traffic. By delaying the traffic,
              the attacker can compromise the service of applications that are sensitive to high
              delays or to high delay variation.</t>
          </section>

        </section>

        <section anchor="IdentificationThreat" title="DetNet Flow Identification">
          <section title="DetNet Flow Modification or Spoofing">
            <t>An attacker can modify some header fields of en route packets in a way that causes
              the DetNet flow identification mechanisms to misclassify the flow. Alternatively, the
              attacker can inject traffic that is tailored to appear as if it belongs to a
              legitimate DetNet flow. The potential consequence is that the DetNet flow resource
              allocation cannot guarantee the performance that is expected when the flow
              identification works correctly.</t>

            <t>Note that in some cases there may be an explicit DetNet header, but in some cases the
              flow identification may be based on fields from the L3/L4 headers. If L3/L4 headers
              are involved, for purposes of this draft we assume they are encrypted and/or
              integrity-protected from external attackers. </t>
          </section>

        </section>

        <section anchor="SegmentThreat" title="Resource Segmentation or Slicing">
          <section title="Inter-segment Attack">
            <t>An attacker can inject traffic, consuming network device resources, thereby affecting
              DetNet flows. This can be performed using non-DetNet traffic that affects DetNet
              traffic, or by using DetNet traffic from one DetNet flow that affects traffic from
              different DetNet flows.</t>
          </section>

        </section>

        <section anchor="ReplicationThreat" title="Packet Replication and Elimination">
          <section title="Replication: Increased Attack Surface">
            <t>Redundancy is intended to increase the robustness and survivability of DetNet flows,
              and replication over multiple paths can potentially mitigate an attack that is limited
              to a single path. However, the fact that packets are replicated over multiple paths
              increases the attack surface of the network, i.e., there are more points in the
              network that may be subject to attacks.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Replication-related Header Manipulation">
            <t>An attacker can manipulate the replication-related header fields (R-TAG). This
              capability opens the door for various types of attacks. For example:</t>

            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>Forward both replicas - malicious change of a packet SN (Sequence Number) can
                  cause both replicas of the packet to be forwarded. Note that this attack has a
                  similar outcome to a replay attack.</t>

                <t>Eliminate both replicas - SN manipulation can be used to cause both replicas to
                  be eliminated. In this case an attacker that has access to a single path can cause
                  packets from other paths to be dropped, thus compromising some of the advantage of
                  path redundancy.</t>

                <t>Flow hijacking - an attacker can hijack a DetNet flow with access to a single
                  path by systematically replacing the SNs on the given path with higher SN values.
                  For example, an attacker can replace every SN value S with a higher value S+C,
                  where C is a constant integer. Thus, the attacker creates a false illusion that
                  the attacked path has the lowest delay, causing all packets from other paths to be
                  eliminated. Once the flow is hijacked the attacker can either replace en route
                  packets with malicious packets, or simply injecting errors, causing the packets to
                  be dropped at their destination.</t>
              </list></t>

          </section>

        </section>

        <section anchor="PathThreat" title="Path Choice">
          <section title="Path Manipulation">
            <t>An attacker can maliciously change, add, or remove a path, thereby affecting the
              corresponding DetNet flows that use the path.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Path Choice: Increased Attack Surface">
            <t>One of the possible consequences of a path manipulation attack is an increased attack
              surface. Thus, when the attack described in the previous subsection is implemented, it
              may increase the potential of other attacks to be performed.</t>

          <section title="Control or Signaling Packet Injection">

          mechanism is being used, and that the corresponding network equipment takes part in this
          mechanism.</t>

      <t> This section describes the impact of the attacks described in <xref target="ThreatSection"
        />. Mitigations are discussed further in <xref target="ThreatMitigation"/>. </t>
      <t> In computer security, the impact (or consequence) of an incident can be measured in loss
        of confidentiality, integrity or availability of information. In other words, this section
        describes the effect of a successful attack. The scope is limited to the effect of a
        successful attack on DetNet itself, not the applications that _use_ Detnet as this is highly
        application specific. </t>

      <section anchor="DelayImpact" title="Delay-Attacks">

        <section title="Data Plane Delay Attacks">
          <t> Dropped messages can result in stream instability. If only a single path is used, the
            entire stream can be disrupted. In a multipath scenario, large delays on one stream can
            lead to increased buffer and CPU resources on the elimination bridge. </t>

            be interrupted and result in outages.</t>

        <section title="Control Plane Delay Attacks">
          <t>In and of itself, this is not directly a threat, the effects of delaying control
            messages can have quite adverse effects later.</t>
          <t>Delayed messages for tear-down can lead to resource leakage if a stream is not torn
            down at the correct time. This can in turn result in failure to allocate new streams
            giving rise to a denial of service attack.</t>
          <t>In the case where an End-point should be added to a multicast, failure to deliver said
            signalling message will prevent the new EP from receiving expected frames.</t>
          <t>Likewise, when an EP should be removed from a multicast group, delaying such messages
            can lead to loss of privacy as the EP will continue to receive messages even after it is
            removed.</t>

        <section title="Flow identification">
          <t> Of all the attacks, this is one of the most difficult to detect and counter. Often, an
            attacker will start out by observing the traffic going through the network and use the
            knowledge gathered in this phase to mount future attacks. </t>
          <t> The attacker can, at their leisure, observe over time all aspects of the messaging and
            signalling, learning the intent and purpose of all traffic flows. At some later date,
            possibly at an important time in an operational context, the attacker can launch a
            multi-faceted attack, possibly in conjunction with some demand for ransom. </t>
          <t> The flow-id in the header of the data plane-messages gives an attacker a very reliable
            identifier for DetNet traffic, and this traffic has a high probability of going to
            lucrative targets. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Spoofing">

          <section title="Dataplane Spoofing">
            <t>Spoofing dataplane messages can result in increased resource consumptions on the
              bridges throughout the network as it will increase buffer usage and CPU utilization.
              This can lead to resource exhaustion and/or increased delay.</t>
            <t>If the attacker manages to create valid headers, the false messages can be forwarded
              through the network, using part of the allocated bandwidth. This in turn can cause
              legitimate messages to be dropped when the budget has been exhausted.</t>
            <t>Finally, the endpoint will have to deal with invalid messages being delivered to the
              endpoint instead of (or in addition to) a valid message.</t>

          </section>

          <section title="Control Plane Spoofing">
            <t>A successful control plane spoofing-attack has a very large potential. It can do
              anything from modifying existing streams by changing the available bandwidth, add or
              remove endpoints or drop the stream altogether. It would also be possible to falsely
              create new streams, which could give an attacker the ability to exhaust the systems
              resources, or just enable a high quality DetNet stream outside the Network engineer's
              control.</t>

        <section title="Data Plane Segmentation">
          <t>Injection of false messages in a DetNet stream could lead to exhaustion of the
            available bandwidth for a stream if the bridges accounts false messages to the stream's
            budget. </t>
          <t>In a multipath scenario, injected messages will cause an increased CPU utilization on
            elimination bridges and if enough paths are subject to malicious injection, the
            legitimate messages could be dropped. Likewise it can cause an increase in buffer usage.
            In total, this will consume more resources on the bridges than normal, giving rise to a
            potential resource exhaustion attack on the bridges.</t>

          <t>If a stream is interrupted, the end application will be affected by what is now a
            non-deterministic stream. </t>

        </section>

        <section title="Control Plane segmentation">
          <t> A successful Control Plane segmentation attack will cause control messages to be
            interpreted by nodes in the network. This has the potential to create new streams
            (exhausting resources), drop existing (denial of service), add/remove end-stations to a
            multicast group (loss of privacy) or modify the stream attributes (reducing available
            bandwidth, or increasing it so that new streams cannot reserve a path).</t>

          <t>In short, this means that you cannot trust the stream reservation properties or the
            network itself. </t>

          <t>As with spoofing, if an attacker is able to inject control-plane messages and the
            receiving end does not detect it, the receiving station must be able to. </t>

      <section title="Impact of Attacks by Use Case Industry">

        <t>This section rates the severity of various components of the impact of a successful
          vulnerability exploit to use cases by industry as described in <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-detnet-use-cases"/>, including Pro Audio, Electrical Utilities,
          Building Automation, Wireless for Industrial, Cellular Radio, and Industrial M2M (split
          into two areas, M2M Data Gathering and M2M Control Loop).</t>

        <t>Components of Impact (left column) include Criticality of Failure, Effects of Failure,
          Recovery, and DetNet Functional Dependence. Criticality of failure summarizes the
          seriousness of the impact. The impact of a resulting failure can affect many different
          metrics that vary greatly in scope and severity. In order to reduce the number of
          variables, the following were included: Financial, Health and Safety, People well being,
          Affect on a single organization, and affect on multiple organizations. Recovery outlines
          how long it would take for an affected use case to get back to its pre-failure state
          (Recovery time objective, RTO), and how much of the original service would be lost in
          between the time of service failure and recovery to original state (Recovery Point
          Objective, RPO). DetNET dependence maps how much the following DetNet service objectives
          contribute to impact of failure: Time dependency, data integrity, source node integrity,
          availability, latency/jitter.</t>

        <t>The scale of the Impact mappings is low, medium, and high. In some use cases there may be
          a multitude of specific applications in which DetNET is used. For simplicity this section
          attempts to average the varied impacts of different applications. This section does not
          address the overall risk of a certain impact which would require the likelihood of a
          failure happening. </t>

        <t>In practice any such ratings will vary from case to case; the ratings shown here are
          given as examples.</t>

        <t>Different attacks can have different impact and/or mitigation depending on the use case,
          so we would like to make this association in our analysis. However since there is a
          potentially unbounded list of use cases, we categorize the attacks with respect to the
          common themes of the use cases as identified in the Use Case Common Themes section of the
          DetNet Use Cases draft <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-use-cases"/>. We describe each theme
          and its associated attacks, impacts and mitigations.</t>

        <section title="Network Layer - AVB/TSN Ethernet">
          <t>Presumably it will be possible to run DetNet over other underlying network layers
            besides Ethernet, but Ethernet is explicitly supported. Is the attack specific to the
            Ethernet AVB/TSN protocols? Does the threat affect only Ethernet, or any underlying
            network layer? </t>

        </section>

        <section title="Central Administration">
          <t>A DetNet network is expected to be controlled by a centralized network configuration
            and control system. Such a system may be in a single central location, or it may be
            distributed across multiple control entities that function together as a unified control
            system for the network. Is the attack directed at threat the central control system of
            the network? Does it interfere with OAM?</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Hot Swap">
          <t>A DetNet network is not expected to be "plug and play" - it is expected that there is
            some centralized network configuration and control system. However, the ability to "hot
            swap" components (e.g. due to malfunction) is similar enough to "plug and play" that
            this kind of behavior may be expected in DetNet networks, depending on the
            implementation. Does the attack target "hot swap" ("plug and play") operation in the
            network? </t>
        </section>


        <section title="Data Flow Information Models">
          <t> Data Flow Information Models specific to DetNet networks are to be specified by
            DetNet. Thus they are "new" and thus potentially present a new attack surface. Does the
            threat take advantage of any aspect of our new Data Flow Info Models? </t>

        </section>


        <section title="L2 and L3 Integration">
          <t>A DetNet network is intended to integrate between Layer 2 (bridged) network(s) (e.g.
            AVB/TSN LAN) and Layer 3 (routed) network(s) (e.g. using IP-based protocols). Does the
            attack target L2? L3? Both? The interaction between the two?</t>

        </section>


        <section title="End-to-End Delivery">
          <t>Packets sent over DetNet are guaranteed not to be dropped by the network due to
            congestion. (Packets may however be dropped for intended reasons, e.g. per security
            measures). Does the attack result in packets (which should be delivered) not being
            delivered? Does it result in packets that should not be delivered being delivered?</t>

        </section>


        <section title="Proprietary Deterministic Ethernet Networks">
          <t>There are many proprietary non-interoperable deterministic Ethernet-based networks
            currently available; DetNet is intended to provide an open-standards-based alternative
            to such networks. Does the threat relate to a specific such network that is being
            "emulated" or "replaced" by DetNet, for example by exploiting specific commands specific
            to that network protocol?</t>

        </section>


        <section title="Replacement for Proprietary Fieldbuses">
          <t>There are many proprietary "field buses" used in today's industrial and other
            industries; DetNet is intended to provide an open-standards-based alternative to such
            buses. Does the threat relate to a specific fieldbus that is being "emulated" or
            "replaced" by DetNet, for example by exploiting specific commands specific to that
            network protocol? </t>

        </section>

        <section title="Deterministic vs Best-Effort Traffic">
          <t>DetNet is intended to support coexistence of time-sensitive operational (OT,
            deterministic) traffic and information (IT, "best effort") traffic on the same
            ("unified") network. Does the attack affect only IT or only OT or both types of traffic?
            Does the threat affect any interaction between IT and OT traffic, e.g. by changing
            relative priority or handling of IT vs. OT packets?</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Deterministic Flows">
          <t>Reserved bandwidth data flows (deterministic flows) must be isolated from each other
            and from best-effort traffic, so that even if the network is saturated with best-effort
            and/or reserved bandwidth traffic the configured flows are not adversely affected. Does
            the attack affect the isolation of one (reserved) flow from another?</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Unused Reserved Bandwidth">
          <t>If bandwidth reservations are made for a stream but the associated bandwidth is not
            used at any point in time, that bandwidth is made available on the network for
            best-effort traffic. If the owner of the reserved stream then starts transmitting again,
            the bandwidth is no longer available for best-effort traffic, on a moment-to-moment
            basis. (Such "temporarily available" bandwidth is not available for time-sensitive
            traffic, which must have its own reservation). Does the attack affect the system's
            ability to allocate unused reserved BW to best-effort traffic?</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Interoperability">
          <t>The DetNet network specifications are intended to enable an ecosystem in which multiple
            vendors can create interoperable products, thus promoting device diversity and
            potentially higher numbers of each device manufactured. Does the threat take advantage
            of differences in implementation of "interoperable" products made by different
            vendors?</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Cost Reductions">
          <t>The DetNet network specifications are intended to enable an ecosystem in which multiple
            vendors can create interoperable products, thus promoting higher numbers of each device
            manufactured, promoting cost reduction and cost competition among vendors. Does the
            threat take advantage of "low cost" HW or SW components or other "cost-related
            shortcuts" that might be present in devices? </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Insufficiently Secure Devices">
          <t>The DetNet network specifications are intended to enable an ecosystem in which multiple
            vendors can create interoperable products, thus promoting device diversity and
            potentially higher numbers of each device manufactured. Does the threat attack "naivete"
            of SW, for example SW that was not designed to be sufficiently secure (or secure at all)
            but is deployed on a DetNet network that is intended to be highly secure? (For example
            IoT exploits like the Mirai video-camera botnet (<xref target="MIRAI"/>). </t>
        </section>

        <section title="DetNet Network Size">
          <t>DetNet networks range in size from very small, e.g. inside a single industrial machine,
            to very large, for example a Utility Grid network spanning a whole country, and
            involving many "hops" over various kinds of links for example radio repeaters, microwave
            links, fiber optic links, etc.. Does the attack affect DetNet networks of only certain
            sizes, e.g. very large networks, or very small? This might be related to how the attack
            is introduced into the network, for example if the entire network is local, there is a
            threat that power can be cut to the entire network. If the network is large, perhaps
            only a part of the network is attacked. Does the threat take advantage of attack vectors
            that are specific to network size?</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Multiple Hops">
          <t>DetNet networks range in size from very small, e.g. inside a single industrial machine,
            to very large, for example a Utility Grid network spanning a whole country, and
            involving many "hops" over various kinds of links for example radio repeaters, microwave
            links, fiber optic links, etc.. Does the attack exploit the presence of more than one
            "hop"? Does the threat exploit the presence of more than one type of "hop", e.g. between
            radio and microwave links? Does the threat exploit a specific type of "hop", e.g.
            something specific to a fiber optic link, or other type of link? </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Level of Service">
          <t>A DetNet is expected to provide means to configure the network that include querying
            network path latency, requesting bounded latency for a given stream, requesting worst
            case maximum and/or minimum latency for a given path or stream, and so on. It is an
            expected case that the network cannot provide a given requested service level. In such
            cases the network control system should reply that the requested service level is not
            available (as opposed to accepting the parameter but then not delivering the desired
            behavior). Does the attack affect any querying or replying to such service-level-related
            traffic? Can the attack cause incorrect responses from the system regarding
            timing-related configuration? For example replying that a requested level of service is
            available when it isn't, or that the requested level of service is not available when it
            actually is available?</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Bounded Latency">
          <t>Does the threat affect the network's ability to deliver packets within the agreed-upon
            latency boundaries?</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Low Latency">
          <t>Applications may require "extremely low latency" however depending on the application
            these may mean very different latency values; for example "low latency" across a Utility
            grid network is on a different time scale than "low latency" in a motor control loop in
            a small machine. The intent is that the mechanisms for specifying desired latency
            include wide ranges, and that architecturally there is nothing to prevent arbitrarily
            low latencies from being implemented in a given network. Does the threat affect the
            network's ability to deliver packets within the agreed-upon low latency? </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Symmetrical Path Delays">
          <t>Some applications would like to specify that the transit delay time values be equal for
            both the transmit and return paths. Does the attack affect the network's ability to
            provide matched transmit and return path delays (latencies)? </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Reliability and Availability">
          <t>DetNet based systems are expected to be implemented with essentially arbitrarily high
            availability (for example 99.9999% up time, or even 12 nines). The intent is that the
            DetNet designs should not make any assumptions about the level of reliability and
            availability that may be required of a given system, and should define parameters for
            communicating these kinds of metrics within the network. Does the attack affect the
            reliability of the DetNet network? Is it a large or small change, e.g. the difference
            between completely taking down the network for some period of time, vs reducing its
            reliability by just one "nine"? Does the threat affect the availability of the DetNet
            network?</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Redundant Paths">
          <t>DetNet based systems are expected to be implemented with essentially arbitrarily high
            reliability/availability. A strategy used by DetNet for providing such extraordinarily
            high levels of reliability is to provide redundant paths that can be seamlessly switched
            between, all the while maintaining the required performance of that system. Does the
            attack affect the configuration or operation of redundant paths? </t>
        </section>


        <section title="Security Measures">
          <t>A DetNet network must be made secure against devices failures, attackers, misbehaving
            devices, and so on. Does the threat affect such security measures themselves, e.g. by
            attacking SW designed to protect against device failure? </t>

    <section title="Appendix A: DetNet Draft Security-Related Statements" anchor="appendix_a">
      <t>This section collects the various statements in the currently existing DetNet Working Group
        drafts. For each draft, the section name and number of the quoted section is shown. The text
        shown here is the work of the original draft authors, quoted verbatim from the drafts. The
        intention is to explicitly quote all relevant text, not to summarize it.</t>

      <section title="Architecture (draft 8)">
        <section title="Fault Mitigation (sec 4.5)">
          <t>One key to building robust real-time systems is to reduce the infinite variety of
            possible failures to a number that can be analyzed with reasonable confidence. DetNet
            aids in the process by providing filters and policers to detect DetNet packets received
            on the wrong interface, or at the wrong time, or in too great a volume, and to then take
            actions such as discarding the offending packet, shutting down the offending DetNet
            flow, or shutting down the offending interface. </t>
          <t>It is also essential that filters and service remarking be employed at the network edge
            to prevent non-DetNet packets from being mistaken for DetNet packets, and thus impinging
            on the resources allocated to DetNet packets. </t>
          <t>There exist techniques, at present and/or in various stages of standardization, that
            can perform these fault mitigation tasks that deliver a high probability that
            misbehaving systems will have zero impact on well-behaved DetNet flows, except of
            course, for the receiving interface(s) immediately downstream of the misbehaving device.
            Examples of such techniques include traffic policing functions (e.g. [RFC2475]) and
            separating flows into per-flow rate- limited queues. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Security Considerations (sec 7)">
          <t>Security in the context of Deterministic Networking has an added dimension; the time of
            delivery of a packet can be just as important as the contents of the packet, itself. A
            man-in-the-middle attack, for example, can impose, and then systematically adjust,
            additional delays into a link, and thus disrupt or subvert a real-time application
            without having to crack any encryption methods employed. See <xref target="RFC7384"/>
            for an exploration of this issue in a related context. </t>

            bizarre errors such as can be caused by software failures. Because there is essential no

          <t>Security in the context of Deterministic Networking has an added dimension; the time of
            delivery of a packet can be just as important as the contents of the packet, itself. A
            man-in-the-middle attack, for example, can impose, and then systematically adjust,
            additional delays into a link, and thus disrupt or subvert a real-time application
            without having to crack any encryption methods employed. See [RFC7384] for an
            exploration of this issue in a related context.</t>

          <t>Typical control networks today rely on complete physical isolation to prevent rogue
            access to network resources. DetNet enables the virtualization of those networks over a
            converged IT/OT infrastructure. Doing so, DetNet introduces an additional risk that
            flows interact and interfere with one another as they share physical resources such as
            Ethernet trunks and radio spectrum. The requirement is that there is no possible data
            leak from and into a deterministic flow, and in a more general fashion there is no
            possible influence whatsoever from the outside on a deterministic flow. The expectation
            is that physical resources are effectively associated with a given flow at a given point
            of time. In that model, Time Sharing of physical resources becomes transparent to the
            individual flows which have no clue whether the resources are used by other flows at
            other times. </t>

        <section title="(Utility Networks) Security Current Practices and Limitations (sec 3.2.1)">
          <t>Grid monitoring and control devices are already targets for cyber attacks, and legacy
            telecommunications protocols have many intrinsic network-related vulnerabilities. For
            example, DNP3, Modbus, PROFIBUS/PROFINET, and other protocols are designed around a
            common paradigm of request and respond. Each protocol is designed for a master device
            such as an HMI (Human Machine Interface) system to send commands to subordinate slave
            devices to retrieve data (reading inputs) or control (writing to outputs). Because many
            of these protocols lack authentication, encryption, or other basic security measures,
            they are prone to network-based attacks, allowing a malicious actor or attacker to
            utilize the request-and-respond system as a mechanism for command-and-control like
            functionality. Specific security concerns common to most industrial control, including
            utility telecommunication protocols include the following: </t>
          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>Network or transport errors (e.g. malformed packets or excessive latency) can cause
                protocol failure. </t>
              <t>Protocol commands may be available that are capable of forcing slave devices into
                inoperable states, including powering-off devices, forcing them into a listen-only
                state, disabling alarming. </t>
              <t>Protocol commands may be available that are capable of restarting communications
                and otherwise interrupting processes. </t>
              <t>Protocol commands may be available that are capable of clearing, erasing, or
                resetting diagnostic information such as counters and diagnostic registers. </t>
              <t>Protocol commands may be available that are capable of requesting sensitive
                information about the controllers, their configurations, or other need-to-know
                information. </t>
              <t>Most protocols are application layer protocols transported over TCP; therefore it
                is easy to transport commands over non-standard ports or inject commands into
                authorized traffic flows. </t>
              <t>Protocol commands may be available that are capable of broadcasting messages to
                many devices at once (i.e. a potential DoS). </t>
              <t>Protocol commands may be available to query the device network to obtain defined
                points and their values (i.e. a configuration scan). </t>
              <t>Protocol commands may be available that will list all available function codes
                (i.e. a function scan). </t>
              <t> These inherent vulnerabilities, along with increasing connectivity between IT an
                OT networks, make network-based attacks very feasible. </t>
              <t>Simple injection of malicious protocol commands provides control over the target
                process. Altering legitimate protocol traffic can also alter information about a
                process and disrupt the legitimate controls that are in place over that process. A
                man-in-the-middle attack could provide both control over a process and
                misrepresentation of data back to operator consoles. </t>

        <section title="(Utility Networks) Security Trends in Utility Networks (sec 3.3.3)">
          <t>Although advanced telecommunications networks can assist in transforming the energy
            industry by playing a critical role in maintaining high levels of reliability,
            performance, and manageability, they also introduce the need for an integrated security
            infrastructure. Many of the technologies being deployed to support smart grid projects
            such as smart meters and sensors can increase the vulnerability of the grid to attack.
            Top security concerns for utilities migrating to an intelligent smart grid

            </list>
          </t>
          <t>This development of a diverse set of networks to support the integration of microgrids,
            open-access energy competition, and the use of network-controlled devices is driving the
            need for a converged security infrastructure for all participants in the smart grid,
            including utilities, energy service providers, large commercial and industrial, as well
            as residential customers. Securing the assets of electric power delivery systems (from
            the control center to the substation, to the feeders and down to customer meters)
            requires an end-to-end security infrastructure that protects the myriad of
            telecommunications assets used to operate, monitor, and control power flow and
            measurement. </t>
          <t>"Cyber security" refers to all the security issues in automation and telecommunications
            that affect any functions related to the operation of the electric power systems.
            Specifically, it involves the concepts of: </t>
          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>Integrity : data cannot be altered undetectably </t>
              <t>Authenticity : the telecommunications parties involved must be validated as genuine </t>
              <t>Authorization : only requests and commands from the authorized users can be
                accepted by the system </t>
              <t>Confidentiality : data must not be accessible to any unauthenticated users </t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>When designing and deploying new smart grid devices and telecommunications systems, it
            is imperative to understand the various impacts of these new components under a variety
            of attack situations on the power grid. Consequences of a cyber attack on the grid
            telecommunications network can be catastrophic. This is why security for smart grid is
            not just an ad hoc feature or product, it's a complete framework integrating both
            physical and Cyber security requirements and covering the entire smart grid networks
            from generation to distribution. Security has therefore become one of the main
            foundations of the utility telecom network architecture and must be considered at every
            layer with a defense-in-depth approach. Migrating to IP based protocols is key to
            address these challenges for two reasons: </t>
          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>IP enables a rich set of features and capabilities to enhance the security posture </t>
              <t>IP is based on open standards, which allows interoperability between different
                vendors and products, driving down the costs associated with implementing security
                solutions in OT networks. </t>

            i.e., consideration must be given to enforcing electronic access control for both
            person-to-machine and machine-to-machine communications, and providing the appropriate
            levels of data privacy, device and platform integrity, and threat detection and
            mitigation. </t>

        <section title="(BAS) Security Considerations (sec 4.2.4)">
          <t>When BAS field networks were developed it was assumed that the field networks would
            always be physically isolated from external networks and therefore security was not a
            concern. In today's world many BASs are managed remotely and are thus connected to
            shared IP networks and so security is definitely a concern, yet security features are
            not available in the majority of BAS field network deployments . </t>
          <t>The management network, being an IP-based network, has the protocols available to
            enable network security, but in practice many BAS systems do not implement even the
            available security features such as device authentication or encryption for data in
            transit. </t>

          <t>On top of the classical requirements for protection of control signaling, it must be
            noted that 6TiSCH networks operate on limited resources that can be depleted rapidly in
            a DoS attack on the system, for instance by placing a rogue device in the network, or by
            obtaining management control and setting up unexpected additional paths. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="(Cellular radio) Security Considerations (sec 6.1.5)">
          <t>Establishing time-sensitive streams in the network entails reserving networking
            resources for long periods of time. It is important that these reservation requests be
            authenticated to prevent malicious reservation attempts from hostile nodes (or
            accidental misconfiguration). This is particularly important in the case where the
            reservation requests span administrative domains. Furthermore, the reservation
            information itself should be digitally signed to reduce the risk of a legitimate node
            pushing a stale or hostile configuration into another networking node. </t>
          <t>Note: This is considered important for the security policy of the network, but does not
            affect the core DetNet architecture and design.</t>
