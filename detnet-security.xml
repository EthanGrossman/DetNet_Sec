    <abstract>
      <t> A deterministic network is one that can carry data flows for real-time applications with
        extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency. Deterministic networks have been
        successfully deployed in real-time operational technology (OT) applications for some years.
        However, such networks are typically isolated from external access, and thus the security
        threat from external attackers is low. IETF Deterministic Networking (DetNet) specifies a
        set of technologies that enable creation of deterministic networks on IP-based networks of
        potentially wide area (on the scale of a corporate network) potentially bringing the OT
        network into contact with Information Technology (IT) traffic and security threats that lie
        outside of a tightly controlled and bounded area (such as the internals of an aircraft).
        These DetNet technologies have not previously been deployed together on a wide area IP-based
        network, and thus can present security considerations that may be new to IP-based wide area
        network designers. This document, intended for use by DetNet network designers, provides
        insight into these security considerations. </t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t> Security is of particularly high importance in DetNet networks because many of the use
        cases which are enabled by DetNet <xref target="RFC8578"/> include control of physical
        devices (power grid components, industrial controls, building controls) which can have high
        operational costs for failure, and present potentially attractive targets for
        cyber-attackers.</t>

      <t>This situation is even more acute given that one of the goals of DetNet is to provide a
        "converged network", i.e. one that includes both IT traffic and OT traffic, thus exposing
        potentially sensitive OT devices to attack in ways that were not previously common (usually
        because they were under a separate control system or otherwise isolated from the IT network,
        for example <xref target="ARINC664P7"/>). Security considerations for OT networks are not a
        new area, and there are many OT networks today that are connected to wide area networks or
        the Internet; this document focuses on the issues that are specific to the DetNet
        technologies and use cases.</t>

      <t>Given the above considerations, securing a DetNet starts with a scrupulously well-designed
        and well-managed engineered network following industry best practices for security at both
        the data plane and control plane; this is the assumed starting point for the considerations
        discussed herein. In this context we view the network design and managment aspects of
        network security as being primarily concerned with denial-of service prevention by ensuring
        that DetNet traffic goes where it's supposed to and that an external attacker can't inject
        traffic that disrupts the DetNet's delivery timing assurance. The time-specific aspects of
        DetNet security presented here take up where the design and management aspects leave off. </t>

      <t> The security requirements for any given DetNet network are necessarily specific to the use
        cases handled by that network. Thus the reader is assumed to be familiar with the specific
        security requirements of their use cases, for example those outlined in the DetNet Use Cases
          <xref target="RFC8578"/> and the Security Considerations sections of the DetNet documents
        applicable to the network technologies in use, for example <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-ip"
        />). </t>

      <t> The DetNet technologies include ways to: <list style="symbols">
          <t> Reserve data plane resources for DetNet flows in some or all of the intermediate nodes
            (e.g. bridges or routers) along the path of the flow</t>
          <t> Provide explicit routes for DetNet flows that do not rapidly change with the network
            topology</t>
          <t> Distribute data from DetNet flow packets over time and/or space to ensure delivery of
            each packet's data' in spite of the loss of a path</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t> This document includes sections on threat modeling and analysis, threat impact and
        mitigation, and the association of attacks with use cases based on the Use Case Common
        Themes section of the DetNet Use Cases <xref target="RFC8578"/>.</t>

    <section anchor="ThreatSection" title="Security Threats">
      <t>This section presents a threat model, and analyzes the possible threats in a DetNet-enabled
        network. The threats considered in this section are independent of any specific technologies
        used to implement the DetNet; <xref target="TechnologySpecificThreats"/>) considers attacks
        that are associated with the DetNet technologies encompassed by <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-detnet-data-plane-framework"/>.</t>

      <t> We distinguish control plane threats from data plane threats. The attack surface may be
        the same, but the types of attacks as well as the motivation behind them, are different. For
        example, a delay attack is more relevant to data plane than to control plane. There is also
        a difference in terms of security solutions: the way you secure the data plane is often
        different than the way you secure the control plane. </t>

      <section title="Threat Model">
        <t>The threat model used in this memo is based on the threat model of Section 3.1 of <xref
            target="RFC7384"/>. This model classifies attackers based on two criteria:</t>

        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Internal vs. external: internal attackers either have access to a trusted segment of
              the network or possess the encryption or authentication keys. External attackers, on
              the other hand, do not have the keys and have access only to the encrypted or
              authenticated traffic.</t>
            <t>Man in the Middle (MITM) vs. packet injector: MITM attackers are located in a
              position that allows interception and modification of in-flight protocol packets,
              whereas a traffic injector can only attack by generating protocol packets.</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t> Care has also been taken to adhere to Section 5 of <xref target="RFC3552"/>, both with
          respect to which attacks are considered out-of-scope for this document, but also which are
          considered to be the most common threats (explored further in <xref
            target="ThreatAnalysis"/>. Most of the direct threats to DetNet are Active attacks, but
          it is highly suggested that DetNet application developers take appropriate measures to
          protect the content of the streams from passive attacks. </t>

        <t>DetNet-Service, one of the service scenarios described in <xref
            target="I-D.varga-detnet-service-model"/>, is the case where a service connects DetNet
          networking islands, i.e. two or more otherwise independent DetNet network domains are
          connected via a link that is not intrinsically part of either network. This implies that
          there could be DetNet traffic flowing over a non-DetNet link, which may provide an
          attacker with an advantageous opportunity to tamper with DetNet traffic. The security
          properties of non-DetNet links are outside of the scope of DetNet Security, but it should
          be noted that use of non-DetNet services to interconnect DetNet networks merits security
          analysis to ensure the integrity of the DetNet networks involved. </t>

      <section anchor="ThreatAnalysis" title="Threat Analysis">

        <section anchor="DelayThreat" title="Delay">
          <section title="Delay Attack">
            <t>An attacker can maliciously delay DetNet data flow traffic. By delaying the traffic,
              the attacker can compromise the service of applications that are sensitive to high
              delays or to high delay variation. The delay may be constant or modulated.</t>
          </section>

        </section>

        <section anchor="ModificationThreat" title="DetNet Flow Modification or Spoofing">
          <t>An attacker can modify some header fields of en route packets in a way that causes the
            DetNet flow identification mechanisms to misclassify the flow. Alternatively, the
            attacker can inject traffic that is tailored to appear as if it belongs to a legitimate
            DetNet flow. The potential consequence is that the DetNet flow resource allocation
            cannot guarantee the performance that is expected when the flow identification works
            correctly.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="SegmentThreat" title="Resource Segmentation or Slicing">
          <section title="Inter-segment Attack">
            <t>An attacker can inject traffic, consuming network device resources, thereby affecting
              DetNet flows. This can be performed using non-DetNet traffic that affects DetNet
              traffic, or by using DetNet traffic from one DetNet flow that affects traffic from
              different DetNet flows.</t>
          </section>

        </section>

        <section anchor="ReplicationThreat" title="Packet Replication and Elimination">
          <section title="Replication: Increased Attack Surface">
            <t>Redundancy is intended to increase the robustness and survivability of DetNet flows,
              and replication over multiple paths can potentially mitigate an attack that is limited
              to a single path. However, the fact that packets are replicated over multiple paths
              increases the attack surface of the network, i.e., there are more points in the
              network that may be subject to attacks.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Replication-related Header Manipulation">
            <t>An attacker can manipulate the replication-related header fields (R-TAG). This
              capability opens the door for various types of attacks. For example:</t>

            <t>
              <list style="symbols">
                <t>Forward both replicas - malicious change of a packet SN (Sequence Number) can
                  cause both replicas of the packet to be forwarded. Note that this attack has a
                  similar outcome to a replay attack.</t>

                <t>Eliminate both replicas - SN manipulation can be used to cause both replicas to
                  be eliminated. In this case an attacker that has access to a single path can cause
                  packets from other paths to be dropped, thus compromising some of the advantage of
                  path redundancy.</t>

                <t>Flow hijacking - an attacker can hijack a DetNet flow with access to a single
                  path by systematically replacing the SNs on the given path with higher SN values.
                  For example, an attacker can replace every SN value S with a higher value S+C,
                  where C is a constant integer. Thus, the attacker creates a false illusion that
                  the attacked path has the lowest delay, causing all packets from other paths to be
                  eliminated. Once the flow is hijacked the attacker can either replace en route
                  packets with malicious packets, or simply injecting errors, causing the packets to
                  be dropped at their destination.</t>
              </list>
            </t>

          </section>

        </section>

        <section anchor="PathThreat" title="Path Choice">
          <section title="Path Manipulation">
            <t>An attacker can maliciously change, add, or remove a path, thereby affecting the
              corresponding DetNet flows that use the path.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Path Choice: Increased Attack Surface">
            <t>One of the possible consequences of a path manipulation attack is an increased attack
              surface. Thus, when the attack described in the previous subsection is implemented, it
              may increase the potential of other attacks to be performed.</t>

          <section title="Control or Signaling Packet Injection">

            <t>A passive eavesdropper can identify DetNet flows and then gather information about en
              route DetNet flows, e.g., the number of DetNet flows, their bandwidths, their
              schedules, or other temporal properties. The gathered information can later be used to
              invoke other attacks on some or all of the flows.</t>

            <t>Note that in some cases DetNet flows may be identified based on an explicit DetNet
              header, but in some cases the flow identification may be based on fields from the
              L3/L4 headers. If L3/L4 headers are involved, for purposes of this document we assume
              they are encrypted and/or integrity-protected from external attackers. </t>

    <section anchor="ThreatImpact" title="Security Threat Impacts">
      <t> This section describes and rates the impact of the attacks described in <xref
          target="ThreatSection"/>. In this section, the impacts as described assume that the
        associated mitigation is not present or has failed. Mitigations are discussed in <xref
          target="ThreatMitigation"/>. </t>

      <t> In computer security, the impact (or consequence) of an incident can be measured in loss
        of confidentiality, integrity or availability of information.</t>

      <t>DetNet raises these stakes significantly for OT applications, particularly those which may
        have been designed to run in an OT-only environment and thus may not have been designed for
        security in an IT environment with its associated devices, services and protocols. </t>

      <t>The severity of various components of the impact of a successful vulnerability exploit to
        use cases by industry is available in more detail in <xref target="RFC8578"/>. Each of the
        use cases in the DetNet Use Cases is represented in the table below, including Pro Audio,
        Electrical Utilities, Industrial M2M (split into two areas, M2M Data Gathering and M2M
        Control Loop), and others.</t>

      <t>Components of Impact (left column) include Criticality of Failure, Effects of Failure,
        Recovery, and DetNet Functional Dependence. Criticality of failure summarizes the
        seriousness of the impact. The impact of a resulting failure can affect many different
        metrics that vary greatly in scope and severity. In order to reduce the number of variables,
        only the following were included: Financial, Health and Safety, People well being (People
        WB), Affect on a single organization, and affect on multiple organizations. Recovery
        outlines how long it would take for an affected use case to get back to its pre-failure
        state (Recovery time objective, RTO), and how much of the original service would be lost in
        between the time of service failure and recovery to original state (Recovery Point
        Objective, RPO). DetNet dependence maps how much the following DetNet service objectives
        contribute to impact of failure: Time dependency, data integrity, source node integrity,
        availability, latency/jitter.</t>

      <t>The scale of the Impact mappings is low, medium, and high. In some use cases there may be a
        multitude of specific applications in which DetNet is used. For simplicity this section
        attempts to average the varied impacts of different applications. This section does not
        address the overall risk of a certain impact which would require the likelihood of a failure
        happening. </t>

      <t>In practice any such ratings will vary from case to case; the ratings shown here are given
        as examples.</t>

        <!-- <xref target="DelayThreat"/> -->
        <section title="Data Plane Delay Attacks">
          <t> Delayed messages in a DetNet link can result in the same behavior as dropped messages
            in ordinary networks as the services attached to the stream has strict deterministic
            requirements.</t>

          <t>For a single path scenario, disruption is a real possibility, whereas in a multipath
            scenario, large delays or instabilities in one stream can lead to increased buffer and
            CPU resources on the elimination bridge.</t>

          <t>A data-plane delay attack on a system controlling substantial moving devices, for
            example in industrial automation, can cause physical damage. For example, if the network
            promises a bounded latency of 2ms for a flow, yet the machine receives it with 5ms
            latency, the machine's control loop can become unstable. </t>

        </section>

        <section title="Control Plane Delay Attacks">
          <t>In and of itself, this is not directly a threat to the DetNet service, but the effects
            of delaying control messages can have quite adverse effects later.</t>
          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>Delayed tear-down can lead to resource leakage, which in turn can result in failure
                to allocate new streams finally giving rise to a denial of service attack.</t>

              <t>Failure to deliver, or severely delaying, signalling messages adding an end-point
                to a multicast-group will prevent the new EP from receiving expected frames thus
                disrupting expected behavior.</t>

              <t>Delaying messages removing an EP from a group can lead to loss of privacy as the EP
                will continue to receive messages even after it is supposedly removed.</t>

        <section title="Flow Modification">
          <t>If the contents of a packet header or body can be modified by the attacker, this can
            cause the packet to be routed incorrectly or dropped, or the payload to be corrupted or
            subtly modified.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Spoofing">

          <section title="Dataplane Spoofing">
            <t>Spoofing dataplane messages can result in increased resource consumptions on the
              bridges throughout the network as it will increase buffer usage and CPU utilization.
              This can lead to resource exhaustion and/or increased delay.</t>
            <t>If the attacker manages to create valid headers, the false messages can be forwarded
              through the network, using part of the allocated bandwidth. This in turn can cause
              legitimate messages to be dropped when the budget has been exhausted.</t>
            <t>Finally, the endpoint will have to deal with invalid messages being delivered to the
              endpoint instead of (or in addition to) a valid message.</t>

          <section title="Control Plane Spoofing">

        <section title="Data Plane Segmentation">
          <t>Injection of false messages in a DetNet stream could lead to exhaustion of the
            available bandwidth for a stream if the bridges accounts false messages to the stream's
            budget. </t>
          <t>In a multipath scenario, injected messages will cause increased CPU utilization in
            elimination bridges. If enough paths are subject to malicious injection, the legitimate
            messages can be dropped. Likewise it can cause an increase in buffer usage. In total, it
            will consume more resources in the bridges than normal, giving rise to a resource
            exhaustion attack on the bridges.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Reconnaissance">
        <t> Of all the attacks, this is one of the most difficult to detect and counter. Often, an
          attacker will start out by observing the traffic going through the network and use the
          knowledge gathered in this phase to mount future attacks. </t>
        <t> The attacker can, at their leisure, observe over time all aspects of the messaging and
          signalling, learning the intent and purpose of all traffic flows. At some later date,
          possibly at an important time in an operational context, the attacker can launch a
          multi-faceted attack, possibly in conjunction with some demand for ransom. </t>
        <t> The flow-id in the header of the data plane-messages gives an attacker a very reliable
          identifier for DetNet traffic, and this traffic has a high probability of going to
          lucrative targets. </t>
        <t>Applications which are ported from a private OT network to the higher visibility DetNet
          environment may need to be adapted to limit distinctive flow properties that could make
          them susceptible to reconnaissance. </t>

        described in <xref target="ThreatSection"/>. These mitigations should be viewed as a toolset
        that includes several different and diverse tools. Each application or system will typically
        use a subset of these tools, based on a system-specific threat analysis.</t>

      <section title="Path Redundancy">

        <t>Description <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
            <t>A DetNet flow that can be forwarded simultaneously over multiple paths. Path
              replication and elimination <xref target="RFC8655"/> provides resiliency to dropped or

              attacks described in <xref target="DelayThreat"/>, <xref target="ModificationThreat"
              />, <xref target="SegmentThreat"/>, and <xref target="SyncThreat"/>. However it is
              also possible that multiple paths may make it more difficult to locate the source of a
              MITM attacker.</t>

      <section anchor="IntegritySection" title="Integrity Protection">

        <t>Description <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
            <t>An integrity protection mechanism, such as a Hash-based Message Authentication Code
              (HMAC) can be used to mitigate modification attacks on IP packets. Integrity
              protection in the control plane is discussed in <xref target="ControlProtectSection"
              />. </t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Packet Sequence Number Integrity Considerations <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
            <t>The use of PREOF in a DetNet implementation implies the use of a sequence number for
              each packet. There is a trust relationship between the device that adds the sequence
              number and the device that removes the sequence number. The sequence number may be
              end-to-end source to destination, or may be added/deleted by network edge devices. The
              adder and remover(s) have the trust relationship because they are the ones that ensure
              that the sequence numbers are not modifiable. Between those two points, there may or
              may not be replication and elimination functions. The elimination functions must be
              able to see the sequence numbers. Therefore any encryption that is done between adders
              and removers must not obscure the sequence number. If the sequence removers and the
              eliminators are in the same physical device, it may be possible to obscure the
              sequence number, however that is a layer violation, and is not recommended
              practice.</t>

      <section title="DetNet Node Authentication">

        <t>Description <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
            <t>Source authentication verifies the authenticity of DetNet sources, enabling
              mitigation of spoofing attacks. Note that while integrity protection (<xref
                target="IntegritySection"/>) prevents intermediate nodes from modifying information,
              authentication can provide traffic origin verification, i.e. to verify that each
              packet in a DetNet flow is from a trusted source. Authentication may be implemented as

      <section title="Encryption">

        <t>Description <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
            <t>DetNet flows can be forwarded in encrypted form at the DetNet layer. Alternatively,
              if the payload is end-to-end encrypted at the application layer, the DetNet nodes
              should not have any need to inspect the payload itself, and thus the DetNet
              implementation can be data-agnostic.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Related attacks <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
            <t>Encryption can be used to mitigate recon attacks (<xref target="SchedulingThreat"/>).
              However, for a DetNet network to give differentiated quality of service on a
              flow-by-flow basis, the network must be able to identify the flows individually. This
              implies that in a recon attack the attacker may also be able to track individual flows
              to learn more about the system.</t>
          </list></t>

        <section title="Encryption Considerations for DetNet">

          <t>Any compute time which is required for encryption and decryption processing ('crypto')
            must be included in the flow latency calculations. Thus, crypto algorithms used in a
            DetNet must have bounded worst-case execution times, and these values must be used in
            the latency calculations. </t>
          <t>Some crypto algorithms are symmetric in encode/decode time (such as AES) and others are
            asymmetric (such as public key algorithms). There are advantages and disadvantages to
            the use of either type in a given DetNet context. </t>
          <t>Asymmetrical crypto is typically not used in networks on a packet-by-packet basis due
            to its computational cost. For example, if only endpoint checks or checks at a small
            number of intermediate points are required, asymmetric crypto can be used to
            authenticate distribution or exchange of a secret symmetric crypto key; a successful
            check based on that key will provide traffic origin verification, as long as the key is
            kept secret by the participants. TLS and IKE (for IPsec) are examples of this for
            endpoint checks.</t>
          <t>However, if secret symmetrical keys are used for this purpose the key must be given to
            all relays, which increases the probability of a secret key being leaked. Also, if any
            relay is compromised or misbehaving it may inject traffic into the flow. </t>
          <t>Alternatively, asymmetric crypto can provide traffic origin verification at every
            intermediate node. For example, a DetNet flow can be associated with an (asymmetric)
            keypair, such that the private key is available to the source of the flow and the public
            key is distributed with the flow information, allowing verification at every node for
            every packet. However, this is more computationally expensive. </t>
          <t>In either case, origin verification also requires replay detection as part of the
            security protocol to prevent an attacker from recording and resending traffic, e.g., as
            a denial of service attack on flow forwarding resources.</t>
          <t>If crypto keys are to be regenerated over the duration of the flow then the time
            required to accomplish this must be accounted for in the latency calculations. </t>

            <t>Information about the network performance can be gathered in real-time in order to

              The gathered information can be based, for example, on per-flow counters, bandwidth
              measurement, and monitoring of packet arrival times. Unusual behavior or potentially
              malicious nodes can be reported to a management system, or can be used as a trigger
              for taking corrective actions. The information can be tracked by DetNet end systems
              and transit nodes, and exported to a management system, for example using NETCONF.</t>

    <section title="Association of Attacks to Use Cases">

      <t>Different attacks can have different impact and/or mitigation depending on the use case, so
        we would like to make this association in our analysis. However since there is a potentially
        unbounded list of use cases, we categorize the attacks with respect to the common themes of
        the use cases as identified in the Use Case Common Themes section of the DetNet Use Cases
          <xref target="RFC8578"/>. </t>

      <t>See also <xref target="ThreatIndustryMapping"/> for a mapping of the impact of attacks per
        use case by industry.</t>

      <section title="Use Cases by Common Themes">

        <t>In this section we review each theme and discuss the attacks that are applicable to that
          theme, as well as anything specific about the impact and mitigations for that attack with
          respect to that theme. The table <xref target="ThemeAttackMapping"/> then provides a
          summary of the attacks that are applicable to each theme. </t>

        <section title="Network Layer - AVB/TSN Ethernet">
          <t>DetNet is expected to run over various transmission mediums, with Ethernet being
            explicitly supported. Attacks such as Delay or Reconnaissance might be implemented
            differently on a different transmission medium, however the impact on the DetNet as a
            whole would be essentially the same. We thus conclude that all attacks and impacts that
            would be applicable to DetNet over Ethernet (i.e. all those named in this document)
            would also be applicable to DetNet over other transmission mediums. </t>

          <t>With respect to mitigations, some methods are specific to the Ethernet medium, for
            example time-aware scheduling using 802.1Qbv can protect against excessive use of
            bandwidth at the ingress - for other mediums, other mitigations would have to be
            implemented to provide analogous protection. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Central Administration">
          <t>A DetNet network is expected to be controlled by a centralized network configuration
            and control system (CNC). Such a system may be in a single central location, or it may
            be distributed across multiple control entities that function together as a unified
            control system for the network. </t>

          <t>In this document we distinguish between attacks on the DetNet Control plane vs. Data
            plane. But is an attack affecting control plane packets synonymous with an attack on the
            CNC itself? For purposes of this document let us consider an attack on the CNC itself to
            be out of scope, and consider all attacks named in this document which are relevant to
            control plane packets to be relevant to this theme, including Path Manipulation, Path
            Choice, Control Packet Modification or Injection, Reconaissance and Attacks on Time Sync
            Mechanisms. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Hot Swap">
          <t>A DetNet network is not expected to be "plug and play" - it is expected that there is
            some centralized network configuration and control system. However, the ability to "hot
            swap" components (e.g. due to malfunction) is similar enough to "plug and play" that
            this kind of behavior may be expected in DetNet networks, depending on the
            implementation. </t>
          <t>An attack surface related to Hot Swap is that the DetNet network must at least consider
            input at runtime from devices that were not part of the initial configuration of the
            network. Even a "perfect" (or "hitless") replacement of a device at runtime would not
            necessarily be ideal, since presumably one would want to distinguish it from the
            original for OAM purposes (e.g. to report hot swap of a failed device). </t>
          <t>This implies that an attack such as Flow Modification, Spoofing or Inter-segment (which
            could introduce packets from a "new" device (i.e. one heretofore unknown on the network)
            could be used to exploit the need to consider such packets (as opposed to rejecting them
            out of hand as one would do if one did not have to consider introduction of a new
            device).</t>
          <t>Similarly if the network was designed to support runtime replacement of a clock device,
            then presence (or apparent presence) and thus consideration of packets from a new such
            device could affect the network, or the time sync of the network, for example by
            initiating a new Best Master Clock selection process. Thus attacks on time sync should
            be considered when designing hot swap type functionality. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Data Flow Information Models">
          <t> Data Flow Information Models specific to DetNet networks are to be specified by
            DetNet. Thus they are "new" and thus potentially present a new attack surface. Does the
            threat take advantage of any aspect of our new Data Flow Info Models? </t>
          <t>This is TBD, thus there are no specific entries in our table, however that does not
            imply that there could be no relevant attacks.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="L2 and L3 Integration">
          <t>A DetNet network integrates Layer 2 (bridged) networks (e.g. AVB/TSN LAN) and Layer 3
            (routed) networks via the use of well-known protocols such as IP, MPLS-PW, and Ethernet. </t>
          <t>There are no specific entries in our table, however that does not imply that there
            could be no relevant attacks related to L2,L3 integration.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="End-to-End Delivery">
          <t>Packets sent over DetNet are not to be dropped by the network due to congestion.
            (Packets may however intentionally be dropped for intended reasons, e.g. per security
            measures). </t>
          <t>A Data plane attack may force packets to be dropped, for example a "long" Delay or
            Replication/Elimination or Flow Modification attack. </t>
          <t>The same result might be obtained by a Control plane attack, e.g. Path Manipulation or
            Signaling Packet Modification.</t>
          <t>It may be that such attacks are limited to Internal MITM attackers, but other
            possibilities should be considered.</t>
          <t>An attack may also cause packets that should not be delivered to be delivered, such as
            by forcing packets from one (e.g. replicated) path to be preferred over another path
            when they should not be (Replication attack), or by Flow Modification, or by Path Choice
            or Packet Injection. A Time Sync attack could cause a system that was expecting certain
            packets at certain times to accept unintended packets based on compromised system time
            or time windowing in the scheduler. </t>
          <t>Packets may also be dropped due to malfunctioning software or hardware.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Proprietary Deterministic Ethernet Networks">
          <t>There are many proprietary non-interoperable deterministic Ethernet-based networks
            currently available; DetNet is intended to provide an open-standards-based alternative
            to such networks. In cases where a DetNet intersects with remnants of such networks or
            their protocols, such as by protocol emulation or access to such a network via a
            gateway, new attack surfaces can be opened. </t>
          <t>For example an Inter-Segment or Control plane attack such as Path Manipulation, Path
            Choice or Control Packet Modification/Injection could be used to exploit commands
            specific to such a protocol, or that are interpreted differently by the different
            protocols or gateway. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Replacement for Proprietary Fieldbuses">
          <t>There are many proprietary "field buses" used in today's industrial and other
            industries; DetNet is intended to provide an open-standards-based alternative to such
            buses. In cases where a DetNet intersects with such fieldbuses or their protocols, such
            as by protocol emulation or access via a gateway, new attack surfaces can be opened.</t>
          <t>For example an Inter-Segment or Control plane attack such as Path Manipulation, Path
            Choice or Control Packet Modification/Injection could be used to exploit commands
            specific to such a protocol, or that are interpreted differently by the different
            protocols or gateway. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Deterministic vs Best-Effort Traffic">
          <t>DetNet is intended to support coexistence of time-sensitive operational (OT,
            deterministic) traffic and information (IT, "best effort") traffic on the same
            ("unified") network. </t>
          <t>With DetNet, this coexistance will become more common, and mitigations will need to be
            established. The fact that the IT traffic on a DetNet is limited to a corporate
            controlled network makes this a less difficult problem compared to being exposed to the
            open Internet, however this aspect of DetNet security should not be underestimated. </t>
          <t>Most of the themes described in this document address OT (reserved) streams - this item
            is intended to address issues related to IT traffic on a DetNet.</t>
          <t>An Inter-segment attack can flood the network with IT-type traffic with the intent of
            disrupting handling of IT traffic, and/or the goal of interfering with OT traffic.
            Presumably if the stream reservation and isolation of the DetNet is well-designed
            (better-designed than the attack) then interference with OT traffic should not result
            from an attack that floods the network with IT traffic. </t>
          <t>However the DetNet's handling of IT traffic may not (by design) be as resilient to DOS
            attack, and thus designers must be otherwise prepared to mitigate DOS attacks on IT
            traffic in a DetNet.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Deterministic Flows">
          <t>Reserved bandwidth data flows (deterministic flows) must provide the allocated
            bandwidth, and must be isolated from each other. </t>
          <t>A Spoofing or Inter-segment attack which adds packet traffic to a bandwidth-reserved
            stream could cause that stream to occupy more bandwidth than it is allocated, resulting
            in interference with other deterministic flows.</t>
          <t>A Flow Modification or Spoofing or Header Manipulation or Control Packet Modification
            attack could cause packets from one flow to be directed to another flow, thus breaching
            isolation between the flows.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Unused Reserved Bandwidth">
          <t>If bandwidth reservations are made for a stream but the associated bandwidth is not
            used at any point in time, that bandwidth is made available on the network for
            best-effort traffic. If the owner of the reserved stream then starts transmitting again,
            the bandwidth is no longer available for best-effort traffic, on a moment-to-moment
            basis. (Such "temporarily available" bandwidth is not available for time-sensitive
            traffic, which must have its own reservation). </t>
          <t>An Inter-segment attack could flood the network with IT traffic, interfering with the
            intended IT traffic.</t>
          <t>A Flow Modification or Spoofing or Control Packet Modification or Injection attack
            could cause extra bandwidth to be reserved by a new or existing stream, thus making it
            unavailable for use by best-effort traffic. </t>

        <section title="Interoperability">
          <t>The DetNet network specifications are intended to enable an ecosystem in which multiple
            vendors can create interoperable products, thus promoting device diversity and
            potentially higher numbers of each device manufactured. Does the threat take advantage
            of differences in implementation of "interoperable" products made by different
            vendors?</t>
          <t>This is TBD, thus there are no specific entries in our table, however that does not

          <t>The DetNet network specifications are intended to enable an ecosystem in which multiple
            vendors can create interoperable products, thus promoting higher numbers of each device
            manufactured, promoting cost reduction and cost competition among vendors. Does the
            threat take advantage of "low cost" HW or SW components or other "cost-related
            shortcuts" that might be present in devices? </t>

            of SW, for example SW that was not designed to be sufficiently secure (or secure at all)
            but is deployed on a DetNet network that is intended to be highly secure? (For example
            IoT exploits like the Mirai video-camera botnet (<xref target="MIRAI"/>). </t>
          <t>This is TBD, thus there are no specific entries in our table, however that does not
            imply that there could be no relevant attacks.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="DetNet Network Size">
          <t>DetNet networks range in size from very small, e.g. inside a single industrial machine,
            to very large, for example a Utility Grid network spanning a whole country. </t>
          <t>The size of the network might be related to how the attack is introduced into the
            network, for example if the entire network is local, there is a threat that power can be
            cut to the entire network. If the network is large, perhaps only a part of the network
            is attacked. </t>
          <t>A Delay attack might be as relevant to a small network as to a large network, although
            the amount of delay might be different. </t>
          <t>Attacks sourced from IT traffic might be more likely in large networks, since more
            people might have access to the network. Similarly Path Manipulation, Path Choice and
            Time Sync attacks seem more likely relevant to large networks.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Multiple Hops">
          <t>Large DetNet networks (e.g. a Utility Grid network) may involve many "hops" over
            various kinds of links for example radio repeaters, microwave links, fiber optic links,
            etc.. </t>
          <t>An attack that takes advantage of flaws (or even normal operation) in the device
            drivers for the various links (through internal knowledge of how the individual driver
            or firmware operates, perhaps like the Stuxnet attack) could take proportionately
            greater advantage of this topology. We don't currently have an attack like this defined;
            we have only "protocol" (time or packet) based attacks. Perhaps we need to define an
            attack like this? Or is that out of scope for DetNet?</t>
          <t>It is also possible that this DetNet topology will not be in as common use as other
            more homogeneous topologies so there may be more opportunity for attackers to exploit
            software and/or protocol flaws in the implementations which have not been wrung out by
            extensive use, particularly in the case of early adopters.</t>
          <t>Of the attacks we have defined, the ones identified above as relevant to "large"
            networks seem to be most relevant.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Level of Service">
          <t>A DetNet is expected to provide means to configure the network that include querying
            network path latency, requesting bounded latency for a given stream, requesting worst
            case maximum and/or minimum latency for a given path or stream, and so on. It is an
            expected case that the network cannot provide a given requested service level. In such
            cases the network control system should reply that the requested service level is not
            available (as opposed to accepting the parameter but then not delivering the desired
            behavior). </t>
          <t>Control plane attacks such as Signaling Packet Modification and Injection could be used
            to modify or create control traffic that could interfere with the process of a user
            requesting a level of service and/or the network's reply.</t>
          <t>Reconnaissance could be used to characterize flows and perhaps target specific flows
            for attack via the Control plane as noted above.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Bounded Latency">
          <t>DetNet provides the expectation of guaranteed bounded latency. </t>
          <t>Delay attacks can cause packets to miss their agreed-upon latency boundaries.</t>
          <t>Time Sync attacks can corrupt the system's time reference, resulting in missed latency
            deadlines (with respect to the "correct" time reference).</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Low Latency">
          <t>Applications may require "extremely low latency" however depending on the application
            these may mean very different latency values; for example "low latency" across a Utility
            grid network is on a different time scale than "low latency" in a motor control loop in
            a small machine. The intent is that the mechanisms for specifying desired latency
            include wide ranges, and that architecturally there is nothing to prevent arbitrarily
            low latencies from being implemented in a given network. </t>
          <t>Attacks on the Control plane (as described in the Level of Service theme) and Delay and
            Time attacks (as described in the Bounded Latency theme) both apply here. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Bounded Jitter (Latency Variation)">
          <t>DetNet is expected to provide bounded jitter (packet to packet latency variation).</t>
          <t>Delay attacks can cause packets to vary in their arrival times, resulting in packet to
            packet latency variation, thereby violating the jitter specification.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Symmetrical Path Delays">
          <t>Some applications would like to specify that the transit delay time values be equal for
            both the transmit and return paths. </t>
          <t>Delay attacks can cause path delays to differ.</t>
          <t>Time Sync attacks can corrupt the system's time reference, resulting in differing path
            delays (with respect to the "correct" time reference).</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Reliability and Availability">
          <t>DetNet based systems are expected to be implemented with essentially arbitrarily high
            availability (for example 99.9999% up time, or even 12 nines). The intent is that the
            DetNet designs should not make any assumptions about the level of reliability and
            availability that may be required of a given system, and should define parameters for
            communicating these kinds of metrics within the network. </t>

          <t>Any attack on the system, of any type, can affect its overall reliability and
            availability, thus in our table we have marked every attack. Since every DetNet depends
            to a greater or lesser degree on reliability and availability, this essentially means
            that all networks have to mitigate all attacks, which to a greater or lesser degree
            defeats the purpose of associating attacks with use cases. It also underscores the
            difficulty of designing "extremely high reliability" networks. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Redundant Paths">
          <t>DetNet based systems are expected to be implemented with essentially arbitrarily high
            reliability/availability. A strategy used by DetNet for providing such extraordinarily
            high levels of reliability is to provide redundant paths that can be seamlessly switched
            between, all the while maintaining the required performance of that system. </t>
          <t>Replication-related attacks are by definition applicable here. Control plane attacks
            can also interfere with the configuration of redundant paths.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Security Measures">
          <t>A DetNet network must be made secure against devices failures, attackers, misbehaving
            devices, and so on. Does the threat affect such security measures themselves, e.g. by
            attacking SW designed to protect against device failure? </t>
          <t>This is TBD, thus there are no specific entries in our table, however that does not
            imply that there could be no relevant attacks.</t>

      <section title="Security Considerations for OAM Traffic">
        <t>This section considers DetNet-specific security considerations for packet traffic that is
          generated and transmitted over a DetNet as part of OAM (Operations, Administration and
          Maintenance). For purposes of this discussion, OAM traffic falls into one of two basic
          types:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>OAM traffic generated by the network itself. The additional bandwidth required for
              such packets is added by the network administration, presumably transparent to the
              customer. Security considerations for such traffic are not DetNet-specific (apart from
              such traffic being subject to the same DetNet-specific security considerations as any
              other DetNet data flow) and are thus not covered in this document.</t>
            <t>OAM traffic generated by the customer. From a DetNet security point of view, DetNet
              security considerations for such traffic are exactly the same as for any other
              customer data flows.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Thus OAM traffic presents no additional (i.e. OAM-specific) DetNet security
          considerations.</t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section anchor="TechnologySpecificThreats" title="DetNet Technology-Specific Threats">
      <t>
        <xref target="ThreatSection"/> described threats which are independent of a DetNet
        implementation. This section considers threats specifically related to the IP- and
        MPLS-specific aspects of DetNet implementations. </t>

      <t>The primary security considerations for the data plane specifically are to maintain the
        integrity of the data and the delivery of the associated DetNet service traversing the
        DetNet network. </t>

      <t>The primary relevant differences between IP and MPLS implementations are in flow
        identification and OAM methodologies.</t>

      <t>As noted in <xref target="RFC8655"/>, DetNet operates at the IP layer (<xref
          target="I-D.ietf-detnet-ip"/>) and delivers service over sub-layer technologies such as
        MPLS (<xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls"/>) and IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)
          (<xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-ip-over-tsn"/>). Application flows can be protected through
        whatever means are provided by the layer and sub-layer technologies. For example,
        technology-specific encryption may be used, such as that provided by IPSec <xref
          target="RFC4301"/> for IP flows and/or by an underlying sub-net using MACSec <xref
          target="IEEE802.1AE-2018"/> for IP over Ethernet (Layer-2) flows. </t>

      <t>However, if the DetNet nodes cannot decrypt IPsec traffic, IPSec may not be a valid option;
        this is because the DetNet IP data plane identifies flows via a 6-tuple that consists of two
        IP addresses, the transport protocol ID, two transport protocol port numbers and the DSCP in
        the IP header. When IPsec is used, the transport header is encrypted and the next protocol
        ID is an IPsec protocol, usually ESP, and not a transport protocol (e.g., neither TCP nor
        UDP, etc.) leaving only three components of the 6-tuple, which are the two IP addresses and
        the DSCP, which are in general not sufficient to identify a DetNet flow. </t>

      <t>Sections below discuss threats specific to IP and MPLS in more detail.</t>

      <section title="IP">

        <t>The IP protocol has a long history of security considerations and architectural
          protection mechanisms. From a data plane perspective DetNet does not add or modify any IP
          header information, and its use as a DetNet Data Plane does not introduce any new security
          issues that were not there before, apart from those already described in the
          data-plane-independent threats section <xref target="ThreatSection"/>. </t>

        <t>Thus the security considerations for a DetNet based on an IP data plane are purely
          inherited from the rich IP Security literature and code/application base, and the
          data-plane-independent section of this document. </t>

        <t>Maintaining security for IP segments of a DetNet may be more challenging than for the
          MPLS segments of the network, given that the IP segments of the network may reach the
          edges of the network, which are more likely to involve interaction with potentially
          malevolent outside actors. Conversely MPLS is inherently more secure than IP since it is
          internal to routers and it is well-known how to protect it from outside influence. </t>

        <t>Another way to look at DetNet IP security is to consider it in the light of VPN security;
          as an industry we have a lot of experience with VPNs running through networks with other
          VPNs, it is well known how to secure the network for that. However for a DetNet we have
          the additional subtlety that any possible interaction of one packet with another can have
          a potentially deleterious effect on the time properties of the flows. So the network must
          provide sufficient isolation between flows, for example by protecting the forwarding
          bandwidth and related resources so that they are available to detnet traffic, by whatever
          means are appropriate for that network's data plane. </t>

      </section>
      <section title="MPLS">
        <t>An MPLS network carrying DetNet traffic is expected to be a "well-managed" network. Given
          that this is the case, it is difficult for an attacker to pass a raw MPLS encoded packet
          into a network because operators have considerable experience at excluding such packets at
          the network boundaries, as well as excluding MPLS packets being inserted through the use
          of a tunnel.</t>

        <t>MPLS security is discussed extensively in <xref target="RFC5920"/> ("Security Framework
          for MPLS and GMPLS Networks") to which the reader is referred.</t>

        <t><xref target="RFC6941"/> builds on <xref target="RFC5920"/> by providing additional
          security considerations that are applicable to the MPLS-TP extensions appropriate to the
          MPLS Transport Profile <xref target="RFC5921"/>, and thus to the operation of DetNet over
          some types of MPLS network.</t>

        <t><xref target="RFC5921"/> introduces to MPLS new Operations, Administration, and
          Maintenance (OAM) capabilities, a transport-oriented path protection mechanism, and strong
          emphasis on static provisioning supported by network management systems. </t>

        <t>The operation of DetNet over an MPLS network is modeled on the operation of multi-segment
          pseudowires (MS-PW). Thus for guidance on securing the DetNet elements of DetNet over MPLS
          the reader is referred to the MS-PW security mechanisms as defined in <xref
            target="RFC4447"/>, <xref target="RFC3931"/>, <xref target="RFC3985"/>, <xref
            target="RFC6073"/>, and <xref target="RFC6478"/>.</t>

        <t>Having attended to the conventional aspects of network security it is necessary to attend
          to the dynamic aspects. The closest experience that the IETF has with securing protocols
          that are sensitive to manipulation of delay are the two way time transfer protocols
          (TWTT), which are NTP <xref target="RFC5905"/> and Precision Time Protocol <xref

        <t>One particular problem that has been observed in operational tests of TWTT protocols is
          the ability for two closely but not completely synchronized streams to beat and cause a
          sudden phase hit to one of the streams. This can be mitigated by the careful use of a
          scheduling system in the underlying packet transport. </t>

        <t>Further consideration of protection against dynamic attacks is work in progress.</t>

    <!-- Change Log
v00 2017-02-22  TM   Initial version
v00 2017-03-09  EAG  Edited for clarity, incorporated comments from sdt review.
v01 2017-06-26  EAG  Added Impact, Mitigation and Use Case Associations text.
v01 2017-06-29  EAG  Integrated review input and Association by Use Case Industry text.
v00 2017-10-04  EAG  First post-WG-adoption (draft-ietf-detnet) version, version reset to 00.
                     Clarify text regarding "Flow Identification" vs "Flow Modification..."
                      1) Remove spurious "DetNet Flow Identification" section header,
                      2) Move 4.2.1. Flow identification text to a new Impact - Recon section.
                     Add missing sections to Impact section - even if empty, mark as ToDo.
                     Mention that impacts as described assume that mitigation is not present or has failed.
v00 2017-10-09 EAG   Rewrite use case themes questions as statements. Update use cases/threats table.
v00 2017-10-25 EAG   Add text for new use cases - to Intro, Industry table, Industry text, etc.
v02 2018-04-23 EAG   Just bump revision to keep draft alive.
v03 2018-10-16 EAG   Add OAM considerations section. Update Tal affiliation. Add new Commmon Theme: Bounded Jitter.
v04 2019-02-11 EAG   Add possible impact of DP delay on physical device e.g. Industrial per Rodney. Add Maik text to use case appendix.
v04 2019-03-02 EAG   Added Encryption Considerations section per list discussion.
v05 2019-08-29 EAG   Add sections for dataplane-specific considerations (IP, MPLS, TSN).
                     Update Use Cases references to RFC 8578.
v06 2019-11-02 EAG   Add placeholder text from Stewart for MPLS dataplane-specific considerations.
                     Removed Kevin Stanton as author. 
                     Added "dummy traffic insertion" based on Norm's comment.
                     Clarified that authentication is used for traffic origin verification (not encryption) per Henrik.
                     Added Packet Sequence Number Integrity Considerations per Norm comment.
                     Occasional auto-reformat changes.
v07 2020-01-10 EAG                        
                     Cut "security statements from drafts" (Appendix A). Add "Reader is assumed to be familiar with the other drafts". 
                     Limit scope to IP and MPLS. (i.e. cut TSN and references to future data planes)
                     Incorporate comment from IETF 106 that flow ID and OAM are the relevant differentiators between MPLS and IP data planes.
                    Note that MPLS is inherently more secure than IP since it is internal to routers.
                    Add assumption of a "very well managed network (both data plane and control plane)" as a starting place for this draft.
                    Incorporate some items from Stewart's review of 12/17/2019 and Henrik's comments 10Jan20. 
                    Replace "draft" with "document" where appropriate. 
                    Put in trivial text for "todo" sections. 
                    
ToDo list:
              Validate use of words "attack" and "threat" is correct - prefer use of "attack" unless necessary.
              Add a new attack type for internal knowledge of drivers/firmware (as in Multiple Hops section)? Is this in scope?
              Fill in ToDo sections.
              ?? Should control plane references be moved to an appendix since currently out of scope for DetNet?
              ?? Pascal pointed out that we could discuss attacks on the UNI, e.g. buffering
