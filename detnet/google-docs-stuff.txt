<section anchor="UseCaseThemes" title="Use Case Common Themes">
Association of Attacks to Use Cases
Different attacks can have different impact and/or mitigation depending on the use case, so we would like to make this association in our analysis. However since there is a potentially unbounded list of use cases, we categorize the attacks with respect to the common themes of the use cases as identified in the Use Case Common Themes section of the DetNet Use Cases draft [UseCasesDraft]. We describe each theme and its associated attacks, impacts and mitigations.
Network Layer - AVB/TSN Ethernet
Presumably it will be possible to run DetNet over other underlying network layers besides Ethernet, but Ethernet is explicitly supported. Is the attack specific to the Ethernet AVB/TSN protocols? Does the threat affect only Ethernet, or any underlying network layer?

Central Administration
A DetNet network is expected to be controlled by a centralized network configuration and control system. Such a system may be in a single central location, or it may be distributed across multiple control entities that function together as a unified control system for the network. Is the attack directed at threat the central control system of the network? Does it interfere with OAM?

Hot Swap
A DetNet network is not expected to be "plug and play" - it is expected that there is some centralized network configuration and control system. However, the ability to "hot swap" components (e.g. due to malfunction) is similar enough to "plug and play" that this kind of behavior may be expected in DetNet networks, depending on the implementation.
Does the attack target “hot swap” (“plug and play”) operation in the network?

Data Flow Information Models
Data Flow Information Models specific to DetNet networks are to be specified by DetNet. Thus they are “new” and thus potentially present a new attack surface.

L2 and L3 Integration
A DetNet network is intended to integrate between Layer 2 (bridged) network(s) (e.g. AVB/TSN LAN) and Layer 3 (routed) network(s) (e.g. using IP-based protocols).
Does the attack target L2? L3? Both? The interaction between the two?

End-to-End Delivery
Packets sent over DetNet are guaranteed not to be dropped by the network due to congestion. (Packets may however be dropped for intended reasons, e.g. per security measures). Does the attack result in packets (which should be delivered) not being delivered? Does it result in packets that should not be delivered being delivered?

Proprietary Deterministic Ethernet Networks
There are many proprietary non-interoperable deterministic Ethernet-based networks currently available; DetNet is intended to provide an open-standards-based alternative to such networks. Does the threat relate to a specific such network that is being “emulated” or “replaced” by DetNet, for example by exploiting specific commands specific to that network protocol?

Deterministic vs Best-Effort Traffic
DetNet is intended to support coexistence of time-sensitive operational (OT, deterministic) traffic and information (IT, “best effort”) traffic on the same ("unified") network. Does the attack affect only IT or only OT or both types of traffic? Does the threat affect any interaction between IT and OT traffic, e.g. by changing relative priority or handling of IT vs. OT packets?

Deterministic Flows
Reserved bandwidth data flows (deterministic flows) must be isolated from each other and from best-effort traffic, so that even if the network is saturated with best-effort and/or reserved bandwidth traffic the configured flows are not adversely affected. Does the attack affect the isolation of one (reserved) flow from another?

Unused Reserved Bandwidth
If bandwidth reservations are made for a stream but the associated bandwidth is not used at any point in time, that bandwidth is made available on the network for best-effort traffic. If the owner of the reserved stream then starts transmitting again, the bandwidth is no longer available for best-effort traffic, on a moment-to-moment basis. (Such "temporarily available" bandwidth is not available for time-sensitive traffic, which must have its own reservation). Does the attack affect the system’s ability to allocate unused reserved BW to best-effort traffic?

Interoperability

Cost Reductions

Does the threat take advantage of “low cost” HW or SW components or other “cost-related shortcuts” that might be present in devices?

Insufficiently Secure Devices
The DetNet network specifications are intended to enable an ecosystem in which multiple vendors can create interoperable products, thus promoting device diversity and potentially higher numbers of each device manufactured. Does the threat attack “naivete” of SW, for example SW that was not designed to be sufficiently secure (or secure at all) but is deployed on a DetNet network that is intended to be highly secure? (For example IoT exploits like the Mirai video-camera botnet [MIRAI]).

DetNet Network Size
DetNet networks range in size from very small, e.g. inside a single industrial machine, to very large, for example a Utility Grid network spanning a whole country, and involving many "hops" over various kinds of links for example radio repeaters, microwave links, fiber optic links, etc.. Does the attack affect DetNet networks of only certain sizes, e.g. very large networks, or very small? This might be related to how the attack is introduced into the network, for example if the entire network is local, there is a threat that power can be cut to the entire network. If the network is large, perhaps only a part of the network is attacked.
Does the threat take advantage of attack vectors that are specific to network size?

DetNet networks range in size from very small, e.g. inside a single industrial machine, to very large, for example a Utility Grid network spanning a whole country, and involving many "hops" over various kinds of links for example radio repeaters, microwave links, fiber optic links, etc.. Does the attack exploit the presence of more than one “hop”? Does the threat exploit the presence of more than one type of “hop”, e.g. between radio and microwave links? Does the threat exploit a specific type of “hop”, e.g. something specific to a fiber optic link, or other type of link?

Level of Service
A DetNet is expected to provide means to configure the network that include querying network path latency, requesting bounded latency for a given stream, requesting worst case maximum and/or minimum latency for a given path or stream, and so on. It is an expected case that the network cannot provide a given requested service level. In such cases the network control system should reply that the requested service level is not available (as opposed to accepting the parameter but then not delivering the desired behavior). Does the attack affect any querying or replying to such service-level-related traffic? Can the attack cause incorrect responses from the system regarding timing-related configuration? For example replying that a requested level of service is available when it isn’t, or that the requested level of service is not available when it actually is available?

Low Latency
Applications may require "extremely low latency" however depending on the application these may mean very different latency values; for example "low latency" across a Utility grid network is on a different time scale than "low latency" in a motor control loop in a small machine. The intent is that the mechanisms for specifying desired latency include wide ranges, and that architecturally there is nothing to prevent arbitrarily low latencies from being implemented in a given network. Does the threat affect the network’s ability to deliver packets within the agreed-upon low latency?

Reliability and Availability
DetNet based systems are expected to be implemented with essentially arbitrarily high availability (for example 99.9999% up time, or even 12 nines). The intent is that the DetNet designs should not make any assumptions about the level of reliability and availability that may be required of a given system, and should define parameters for communicating these kinds of metrics within the network. Does the attack affect the reliability of the DetNet network? Is it a large or small change, e.g. the difference between completely taking down the network for some period of time, vs reducing its reliability by just one “nine”? Does the threat affect the availability of the DetNet network?

Redundant Paths
DetNet based systems are expected to be implemented with essentially arbitrarily high reliability/availability. A strategy used by DetNet for providing such extraordinarily high levels of reliability is to provide redundant paths that can be seamlessly switched between, all the while maintaining the required performance of that system. Does the attack affect the configuration or operation of redundant paths?
