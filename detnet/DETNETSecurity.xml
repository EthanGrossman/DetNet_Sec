    <abstract>
      <t> A deterministic network is one that can carry data flows for real-time applications with
        extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency. Deterministic networks have been
        successfully deployed in real-time operational technology (OT) applications for some years
        (for example <xref target="ARINC664P7"/>). However, such networks are typically isolated
        from external access, and thus the security threat from external attackers is low. IETF
        Deterministic Networking (DetNet) specifies a set of technologies that enable creation of
        deterministic networks on IP-based networks of potentially wide area (on the scale of a
        corporate network) potentially bringing the OT network into contact with Information
        Technology (IT) traffic and security threats that lie outside of a tightly controlled and
        bounded area (such as the internals of an aircraft). These DetNet technologies have not
        previously been deployed together on a wide area IP-based network, and thus can present
        security considerations that may be new to IP-based wide area network designers. This draft,
        intended for use by DetNet network designers, provides insight into these security
        considerations. In addition, this draft collects all security-related statements from the
        various DetNet drafts (Architecture, Use Cases, etc) into a single location <xref
          target="appendix_a"/>. </t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

 <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t> Security is of particularly high importance in DetNet networks because many of the use
        cases which are enabled by DetNet <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-use-cases"/> include control
        of physical devices (power grid components, industrial controls, building controls) which
        can have high operational costs for failure, and present potentially attractive targets for
        cyber-attackers.</t>

      <t>This situation is even more acute given that one of the goals of DetNet is to provide a
        "converged network", i.e. one that includes both IT traffic and OT traffic, thus exposing
        potentially sensitive OT devices to attack in ways that were not previously common (usually
        because they were under a separate control system or othewise isolated from the IT network).
        Security considerations for OT networks is not a new area, and there are many OT networks
        today that are connected to wide area networks or the Internet; this draft focuses on the
        issues that are specific to the DetNet technologies and use cases.</t>

      <t> This initial version of this draft consists of a threat model and analysis, and in the
        future will be expanded to include mitigation strategies.</t>

      <t>This draft also provides context for the DetNet security considerations by collecting into
        one place <xref target="appendix_a"/> the various remarks about security from the various
        DetNet drafts (Use Cases, Architecture, etc). This text is duplicated here primarily because
        the DetNet working group has elected not to produce a Requirements draft and thus
        collectively these statements are as close as we have to "DetNet Security Requirements". </t>

      <t> The DetNet technologies include ways to: <list style="symbols">
          <t> Reserve data plane resources for DetNet flows in some or all of the intermediate nodes
            (e.g. bridges or routers) along the path of the flow</t>
          <t> Provide explicit routes for DetNet flows that do not rapidly change with the network
            topology</t>
          <t> Distribute data from DetNet flow packets over time and/or space to ensure delivery of
            each packet's data' in spite of the loss of a path</t>
        </list>

    <section anchor="ThreatSection" title="Security Threats">
      <t>This section presents a threat model, and analyzes the possible threats in a DetNet-enabled
        network.</t>

      <t> We distinguish control plane threats from data plane threats. The attack surface may be
        the same, but the types of attacks are different. For example, a delay attack is more
        relevant to data plane than to control plane. There is also a difference in terms of
        security solutions: the way you secure the data plane is often different than the way you
        secure the control plane. </t>

      <section title="Threat Model">
        <t>The threat model used in this memo is based on the threat model of Section 3.1 of <xref
            target="RFC7384"/>. This model is briefly presented in this subsection.</t>

        <t>The model classifies attackers based on two criteria:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Internal vs. external: internal attackers either have access to a trusted segment of
              the network or possess the encryption or authentication keys. External attackers, on
              the other hand, do not have the keys and have access only to the encrypted or
              authenticated traffic.</t>
            <t>Man in the Middle (MITM) vs. packet injector: MITM attackers are located in a
              position that allows interception and modification of in-flight protocol packets,
              whereas a traffic injector can only attack by generating protocol packets.</t>
          </list></t>

      <section anchor="ThreatAnalysis" title="Threat Analysis">

        <section anchor="DelayThreat" title="Threats Related to Delay">
          <section title="Delay Attack">
            <t>An attacker can maliciously delay DetNet data flow traffic. By delaying the traffic,
              the attacker can compromise the service of applications that are sensitive to high
              delays or to high delay variation.</t>

        <section anchor="IdentificationThreat" title="Threats Related to DetNet Flow Identification">
          <section title="DetNet Flow Modification or Spoofing">
            <t>An attacker can modify some header fields of en route packets in a way that causes
              the DetNet flow identification mechanisms to misclassify the flow. Alternatively, the
              attacker can inject traffic that is tailored to appear as if it belongs to a
              legitimate DetNet flow. The potential consequence is that the DetNet flow resource
              allocation cannot guarantee the performance that is expected when the flow
              identification works correctly.</t>

            <t>Note that in some cases there may be an explicit DetNet header, but in some cases the
              flow identification may be based on fields from the L3/L4 headers. If L3/L4 headers
              are involved, for purposes of this draft we assume they are encrypted and/or
              integrity-protected from external attackers. </t>

        <section anchor="SegmentThreat" title="Threats Related to Resource Segmentation or Slicing">
          <section title="Inter-segment Attack">
            <t>An attacker can inject traffic, consuming network device resources, thereby affecting
              DetNet flows. This can be performed using non-DetNet traffic that affects DetNet
              traffic, or by using DetNet traffic from one DetNet flow that affects traffic from
              different DetNet flows.</t>
          </section>

        </section>

        <section anchor="ReplicationThreat" title="Threats Related to Packet Replication and Elimination">
          <section title="Replication: Increased Attack Surface">
            <t>Redundancy is intended to increase the robustness and survivability of DetNet flows,
              and replication over multiple paths can potentially mitigate an attack that is limited
              to a single path. However, the fact that packets are replicated over multiple paths
              increases the attack surface of the network, i.e., there are more points in the
              network that may be subject to attacks.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Replication-related Header Manipulation">
            <t>An attacker can manipulate the replication-related header fields (R-TAG). This
              capability opens the door for various types of attacks. For example:</t>

            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>Forward both replicas - malicious change of a packet SN (Sequence Number) can
                  cause both replicas of the packet to be forwarded. Note that this attack has a
                  similar outcome to a replay attack.</t>

                <t>Eliminate both replicas - SN manipulation can be used to cause both replicas to
                  be eliminated. In this case an attacker that has access to a single path can cause
                  packets from other paths to be dropped, thus compromising some of the advantage of
                  path redundancy.</t>

                <t>Flow hijacking - an attacker can hijack a DetNet flow with access to a single
                  path by systematically replacing the SNs on the given path with higher SN values.
                  For example, an attacker can replace every SN value S with a higher value S+C,
                  where C is a constant integer. Thus, the attacker creates a false illusion that
                  the attacked path has the lowest delay, causing all packets from other paths to be
                  eliminated. Once the flow is hijacked the attacker can either replace en route
                  packets with malicious packets, or simply injecting errors, causing the packets to
                  be dropped at their destination.</t>
              </list></t>

          </section>

        </section>

        <section anchor="PathThreat" title="Threats Related to Path Choice">
          <section title="Path Manipulation">
            <t>An attacker can maliciously change, add, or remove a path, thereby affecting the
              corresponding DetNet flows that use the path.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Path Choice: Increased Attack Surface">
            <t>One of the possible consequences of a path manipulation attack is an increased attack
              surface. Thus, when the attack described in the previous subsection is implemented, it
              may increase the potential of other attacks to be performed.</t>

Unusual behavior or potentially malicious nodes can be reported to a management system, or can be used as a trigger for taking corrective actions. The information can be tracked by DetNet end systems and transit nodes, and exported to a management system, for example using NETCONF.</t>

    <section title="Appendix A: DetNet Draft Security-Related Statements" anchor="appendix_a">
      <t>This section collects the various statements in the currently existing DetNet Working Group
        drafts. For each draft, the section name and number of the quoted section is shown. The text
        shown here is the work of the original draft authors, quoted verbatim from the drafts. The
        intention is to explicitly quote all relevant text, not to summarize it.</t>

      <section title="Architecture (draft 8)">
        <section title="Fault Mitigation (sec 4.5)">
          <t>One key to building robust real-time systems is to reduce the infinite variety of
            possible failures to a number that can be analyzed with reasonable confidence. DetNet
            aids in the process by providing filters and policers to detect DetNet packets received
            on the wrong interface, or at the wrong time, or in too great a volume, and to then take
            actions such as discarding the offending packet, shutting down the offending DetNet
            flow, or shutting down the offending interface. </t>
          <t>It is also essential that filters and service remarking be employed at the network edge
            to prevent non-DetNet packets from being mistaken for DetNet packets, and thus impinging
            on the resources allocated to DetNet packets. </t>
          <t>There exist techniques, at present and/or in various stages of standardization, that
            can perform these fault mitigation tasks that deliver a high probability that
            misbehaving systems will have zero impact on well-behaved DetNet flows, except of
            course, for the receiving interface(s) immediately downstream of the misbehaving device.
            Examples of such techniques include traffic policing functions (e.g. [RFC2475]) and
            separating flows into per-flow rate- limited queues. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Security Considerations (sec 7)">
          <t>Security in the context of Deterministic Networking has an added dimension; the time of
            delivery of a packet can be just as important as the contents of the packet, itself. A
            man-in-the-middle attack, for example, can impose, and then systematically adjust,
            additional delays into a link, and thus disrupt or subvert a real-time application
            without having to crack any encryption methods employed. See <xref target="RFC7384"/>
            for an exploration of this issue in a related context. </t>
          <t>Furthermore, in a control system where millions of dollars of equipment, or even human
            lives, can be lost if the DetNet QoS is not delivered, one must consider not only simple
            equipment failures, where the box or wire instantly becomes perfectly silent, but
            bizarre errors such as can be caused by software failures. Because there is essential no
            limit to the kinds of failures that can occur, protecting against realistic equipment
            failures is indistinguishable, in most cases, from protecting against malicious
            behavior, whether accidental or intentional. </t>

            technologies already have. </t>

      <section title="Problem Statement (draft 5)">
        <section title="Security Considerations (sec 5)">
          <t>Security in the context of Deterministic Networking has an added dimension; the time of
            delivery of a packet can be just as important as the contents of the packet, itself. A
            man-in-the-middle attack, for example, can impose, and then systematically adjust,

            exploration of this issue in a related context.</t>

          <t>Typical control networks today rely on complete physical isolation to prevent rogue
            access to network resources. DetNet enables the virtualization of those networks over a
            converged IT/OT infrastructure. Doing so, DetNet introduces an additional risk that
            flows interact and interfere with one another as they share physical resources such as
            Ethernet trunks and radio spectrum. The requirement is that there is no possible data
            leak from and into a deterministic flow, and in a more general fashion there is no
            possible influence whatsoever from the outside on a deterministic flow. The expectation
            is that physical resources are effectively associated with a given flow at a given point
            of time. In that model, Time Sharing of physical resources becomes transparent to the
            individual flows which have no clue whether the resources are used by other flows at
            other times. </t>

        <section title="(Utility Networks) Security Current Practices and Limitations (sec 3.2.1)">
          <t>Grid monitoring and control devices are already targets for cyber attacks, and legacy
            telecommunications protocols have many intrinsic network-related vulnerabilities. For
            example, DNP3, Modbus, PROFIBUS/PROFINET, and other protocols are designed around a
            common paradigm of request and respond. Each protocol is designed for a master device
            such as an HMI (Human Machine Interface) system to send commands to subordinate slave
            devices to retrieve data (reading inputs) or control (writing to outputs). Because many
            of these protocols lack authentication, encryption, or other basic security measures,
            they are prone to network-based attacks, allowing a malicious actor or attacker to
            utilize the request-and-respond system as a mechanism for command-and-control like
            functionality. Specific security concerns common to most industrial control, including
            utility telecommunication protocols include the following: </t>
          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>Network or transport errors (e.g. malformed packets or excessive latency) can cause
                protocol failure. </t>
              <t>Protocol commands may be available that are capable of forcing slave devices into
                inoperable states, including powering-off devices, forcing them into a listen-only
                state, disabling alarming. </t>
              <t>Protocol commands may be available that are capable of restarting communications
                and otherwise interrupting processes. </t>
              <t>Protocol commands may be available that are capable of clearing, erasing, or
                resetting diagnostic information such as counters and diagnostic registers. </t>
              <t>Protocol commands may be available that are capable of requesting sensitive
                information about the controllers, their configurations, or other need-to-know
                information. </t>
              <t>Most protocols are application layer protocols transported over TCP; therefore it
                is easy to transport commands over non-standard ports or inject commands into
                authorized traffic flows. </t>
              <t>Protocol commands may be available that are capable of broadcasting messages to
                many devices at once (i.e. a potential DoS). </t>
              <t>Protocol commands may be available to query the device network to obtain defined
                points and their values (i.e. a configuration scan). </t>
              <t>Protocol commands may be available that will list all available function codes
                (i.e. a function scan). </t>
              <t> These inherent vulnerabilities, along with increasing connectivity between IT an
                OT networks, make network-based attacks very feasible. </t>
              <t>Simple injection of malicious protocol commands provides control over the target
                process. Altering legitimate protocol traffic can also alter information about a
                process and disrupt the legitimate controls that are in place over that process. A
                man-in-the-middle attack could provide both control over a process and
                misrepresentation of data back to operator consoles. </t>

        <section title="(Utility Networks) Security Trends in Utility Networks (sec 3.3.3)">
          <t>Although advanced telecommunications networks can assist in transforming the energy
            industry by playing a critical role in maintaining high levels of reliability,
            performance, and manageability, they also introduce the need for an integrated security
            infrastructure. Many of the technologies being deployed to support smart grid projects
            such as smart meters and sensors can increase the vulnerability of the grid to attack.
            Top security concerns for utilities migrating to an intelligent smart grid
            telecommunications platform center on the following trends: </t>
          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>Integration of distributed energy resources </t>
              <t>Proliferation of digital devices to enable management, automation, protection, and
                control </t>
              <t>Regulatory mandates to comply with standards for critical infrastructure protection </t>
              <t>Migration to new systems for outage management, distribution automation,

          </t>
          <t>This development of a diverse set of networks to support the integration of microgrids,
            open-access energy competition, and the use of network-controlled devices is driving the
            need for a converged security infrastructure for all participants in the smart grid,
            including utilities, energy service providers, large commercial and industrial, as well
            as residential customers. Securing the assets of electric power delivery systems (from
            the control center to the substation, to the feeders and down to customer meters)
            requires an end-to-end security infrastructure that protects the myriad of
            telecommunications assets used to operate, monitor, and control power flow and
            measurement. </t>
          <t>"Cyber security" refers to all the security issues in automation and telecommunications
            that affect any functions related to the operation of the electric power systems.
            Specifically, it involves the concepts of: </t>
          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>Integrity : data cannot be altered undetectably </t>
              <t>Authenticity : the telecommunications parties involved must be validated as genuine </t>
              <t>Authorization : only requests and commands from the authorized users can be
                accepted by the system </t>
              <t>Confidentiality : data must not be accessible to any unauthenticated users </t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>When designing and deploying new smart grid devices and telecommunications systems, it
            is imperative to understand the various impacts of these new components under a variety
            of attack situations on the power grid. Consequences of a cyber attack on the grid
            telecommunications network can be catastrophic. This is why security for smart grid is
            not just an ad hoc feature or product, it's a complete framework integrating both
            physical and Cyber security requirements and covering the entire smart grid networks
            from generation to distribution. Security has therefore become one of the main
            foundations of the utility telecom network architecture and must be considered at every
            layer with a defense-in-depth approach. Migrating to IP based protocols is key to
            address these challenges for two reasons: </t>
          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>IP enables a rich set of features and capabilities to enhance the security posture </t>
              <t>IP is based on open standards, which allows interoperability between different
                vendors and products, driving down the costs associated with implementing security
                solutions in OT networks. </t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>Securing OT (Operation technology) telecommunications over packet- switched IP networks
            follow the same principles that are foundational for securing the IT infrastructure,
            i.e., consideration must be given to enforcing electronic access control for both
            person-to-machine and machine-to-machine communications, and providing the appropriate
            levels of data privacy, device and platform integrity, and threat detection and
            mitigation. </t>

        <section title="(BAS) Security Considerations (sec 4.2.4)">
          <t>When BAS field networks were developed it was assumed that the field networks would
            always be physically isolated from external networks and therefore security was not a
            concern. In today's world many BASs are managed remotely and are thus connected to
            shared IP networks and so security is definitely a concern, yet security features are
            not available in the majority of BAS field network deployments . </t>
          <t>The management network, being an IP-based network, has the protocols available to
            enable network security, but in practice many BAS systems do not implement even the
            available security features such as device authentication or encryption for data in
            transit. </t>

        <section title="(6TiSCH) Security Considerations (sec 5.3.3)">
          <t>On top of the classical requirements for protection of control signaling, it must be
            noted that 6TiSCH networks operate on limited resources that can be depleted rapidly in
            a DoS attack on the system, for instance by placing a rogue device in the network, or by
            obtaining management control and setting up unexpected additional paths. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="(Cellular radio) Security Considerations (sec 6.1.5)">
          <t>Establishing time-sensitive streams in the network entails reserving networking
            resources for long periods of time. It is important that these reservation requests be
            authenticated to prevent malicious reservation attempts from hostile nodes (or
            accidental misconfiguration). This is particularly important in the case where the
            reservation requests span administrative domains. Furthermore, the reservation
            information itself should be digitally signed to reduce the risk of a legitimate node
            pushing a stale or hostile configuration into another networking node. </t>
          <t>Note: This is considered important for the security policy of the network, but does not
            affect the core DetNet architecture and design.</t>

        <section title="(Industrial M2M) Communication Today (sec 7.2)">
          <t>Industrial network scenarios require advanced security solutions. Many of the current
            industrial production networks are physically separated. Preventing critical flows from
            be leaked outside a domain is handled today by filtering policies that are typically
            enforced in firewalls. </t>
